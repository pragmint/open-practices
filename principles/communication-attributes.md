# Communication Attributes

There are many concepts that I have found are easier to explain if there is a
vocabulary around attributes of communication. This is an attempt at laying out
some of that vocabulary to support more complicated explanations.

## Resolution

Not all modes of communication provide the same amount of information. Some
modes of communication can be ambiguous of the intent behind the words. A small
text message is going to tell you a lot less than hearing the words spoken.
Lets think about the example sentence of "Ya, have a great day". Just reading
the words gives you some information and probably has a positive tone. However,
I'm sure you can imagine a tone of sarcasm that completely changes the meaning
of the sentence. The fact that it spoken provides more information and in many
cases different information than simply text.

In general I think of the levels of resolution going from lowest to highest
resolution:

1. Text
1. Audio
1. Audio + Video
1. In Person

Some may argue that audio + video can be just as effective as in person. I
suggest that is simply not true. Research studies like
[this](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2713432/) one show that we, as
animals, produce hormones and which are picked up by other people. These
hormones can communicate conditions or attitudes that simply cannot be
communicated without being in person. So, until such time as we have virtual
olfactory communication and such technology is deemed appropriate and not
invasive to use in the professional sphere, it is unlikely I will consider
audio and video as equally high resolution communication as being in person.
