# Communication Attributes

There are many concepts that I have found are easier to explain if there is a
vocabulary around attributes of communication. This is an attempt at laying out
some of that vocabulary to support more complicated explanations.

## Definition of Communication

Communication with respect to these attributes will be defined as information
that is in one person's mind being transferred to another person's mind.

## Messages

For the purpose of these definitions, a message is any attempt of one person to
send information to another. The message could be an email, a text message, a
pull request or it can simply be the spoken word. There is nearly no end to the
variety of messages that can be sent and each has varying attributes about it
that makes it more or less effective depending on the situation. 

## Resolution

Not all modes of communication provide the same amount of information. Some
modes of communication can be ambiguous of the intent behind the words. A small
text message is going to tell you a lot less than hearing the words spoken.
Lets think about the example sentence of "Ya, have a great day". Just reading
the words gives you some information and probably has a positive tone. However,
I'm sure you can imagine a tone of sarcasm that completely changes the meaning
of the sentence. The fact that it spoken provides more information and in many
cases different information than simply text.

In general I think of the levels of resolution going from lowest to highest
resolution:

1. Text
1. Audio
1. Audio + Video
1. In Person

Some may argue that audio + video can be just as effective as in person. I
suggest that is simply not true. Research studies like
[this](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2713432/) one show that we, as
animals, produce hormones and which are picked up by other people. These
hormones can communicate conditions or attitudes that simply cannot be
communicated without being in person. So, until such time as we have virtual
olfactory communication and such technology is deemed appropriate and not
invasive to use in the professional sphere, it is unlikely I will consider
audio and video as equally high resolution communication as being in person.

## Latency

Latency is the amount of time between when the message is sent and when the
message is received. In general lower latency is better. Some examples of
latency from low to high might be:

1. Physical Letter
1. Email
1. Text message
1. Verbal conversation

It's important to note the examples above are not a hard and fast rule. The
classic image of teenagers texting while in the room with a bunch of other
people is an example of when text messaging can be lower latency than verbal
conversation. In practice, latency is more about engagement in the conversation
and mental work in progress than it is about the time between send and receive.

## Frequency

It may feel like Frequency and latency are the same but there is a slight
difference. Frequency is how often a message is sent and Latency is how long
the message take to get to the receiver.

If I sent 1 letter a day to my friend and each letter took a week to get there,
that would be high frequency and low latency.

## Volume

Volume is the amount of information being transferred between two people.
Please note that volume has a dependent relationship with other attributes.

A large volume of information necessitates longer latency. This is easy to see
by a quick example.

If I hand you three large text books in a row, the frequency of messages is
fast and the volume is high but the latency might be different for each book or
even each chapter. I might read the first two chapters tonight but it could
take me a month to get to the last chapter of the last book.

This means volume has a dependent relationship with latency. This can be
negated with context dependent communication. See the section on context
dependent communication for more details.

## Ephemeral and Persistent

Please note that ephemeral and persistent messages are fluid in many ways. I
can delete voicemail, I can send a self destroying message like on Snapchat and
many other scenarios that make these definitions imprecise but still useful.

### Ephemeral Messages

Ephemeral communication is made up of messages that disappear or never have a
physical manifestation at all. If I tell you something with my voice, it's
ephemeral because I won't be able to reference what I said later unless what
was said was remembered.

### Persistent Messages

Persistent communication is made up of messages that stick around. If I send
you a text message or an email I can later come back and view, audit or
reference the exact message I sent you.

## Context Dependent Communication
