# Communication Attributes

There are many concepts that I have found are easier to explain if there is a
vocabulary around attributes of communication. This is an attempt at laying out
some of that vocabulary to support more complicated explanations.

## Resolution

Not all modes of communication provide the same amount of information. Some
modes of communication can be ambiguous of the intent behind the words. A small
text message is going to tell you a lot less than hearing the words spoken.
Lets think about the example sentence of "Ya, have a great day". Just reading
the words gives you some information and probably has a positive tone. However,
I'm sure you can imagine a tone of sarcasm that completely changes the meaning
of the sentence. The fact that it spoken provides more information and in many
cases different information than simply text.

In general I think of the levels of resolution going from lowest to highest
resolution:

1. Text
1. Audio
1. Audio + Video
1. In Person

Some may argue that audio + video can be just as effective as in person. I
suggest that is simply not true. Research studies like
[this](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2713432/) one show that we, as
animals, produce hormones and which are picked up by other people. These
hormones can communicate conditions or attitudes that simply cannot be
communicated without being in person. So, until such time as we have virtual
olfactory communication and such technology is deemed appropriate and not
invasive to use in the professional sphere, it is unlikely I will consider
audio and video as equally high resolution communication as being in person.

## Latency

Latency is the amount of time between messages while communicating. Not always
but in general lower latency is better. Some examples of latency from low to
high might be:

1. Physical Letter
1. Email
1. Text message
1. Verbal conversation

It's important to note the examples above are not a hard and fast rule. The
classic image of teenagers texting while in the room with a bunch of other
people exemplifies a time when text messaging can be lower latency
than verbal conversation.

Latency, at times, is more about engagement in the conversation and mental work
in progress than it is about the time spent between messages.
