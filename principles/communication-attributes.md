# Communication Attributes

There are many concepts are easier to explain if there is a vocabulary around
attributes of communication. This is an attempt at laying out some of that
vocabulary to support more complicated concepts or explanations.

## Definition of Communication

Communication with respect to these attributes will be defined as information
that is in one person's mind being transferred to another person's mind.

## Messages

A message is any attempt of one person to send information to another. The
message could be an email, a text message, a pull request or it can simply be
the spoken word. There is nearly no end to the variety of messages that can be
sent and each different attributes about it that make it more or less effective
in different situations. 

## Resolution

Not all modes of communication provide the same amount of information. A small
text message is going convey a lot less face to face communication. To
illustrate this think about the example sentence of "Ya, have a great day".
Just reading the words gives you some information and probably has a positive
tone. However, there is a tone of sarcasm that completely changes the meaning
of the sentence. The fact that it spoken provides more information, and in some
cases, different information than simple text.

An example of different message types having lower or higher resolution might
look like following from low resolution to high resolution:

1. Text
2. Audio
3. Audio + Video
4. In Person

Some may argue that audio + video can be just as effective as in person. Some
studies suggest otherwise. A study like
[this](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2713432/) one shows that we, as
animals, produce hormones which are picked up by other people. These hormones
can communicate conditions or attitudes that simply cannot be communicated
without being in person. So, until such time as we have virtual olfactory
communication and such technology is deemed appropriate and non-invasive to use
in the professional sphere, it is safe to consider audio and video as lower
resolution than being in person.

## Latency

Latency is the amount from when the message is sent and when the message is
received. In general lower latency is better. Some examples of latency from low
to high might be:

1. Physical Letter
2. Email
3. Text message
4. Verbal conversation

It's important to note the examples above are not a hard and fast rule. The
classic image of teenagers texting while in the room with a bunch of other
people is an example of when text messaging can be lower latency than verbal
conversation. In practice, latency is more about engagement in the conversation
and mental multitasking than it is about the time between send and receive.

## Frequency

It may feel like Frequency and latency are the same but there is a slight
difference. Frequency is how often a message is sent and Latency is how long
the message takes to get to the receiver.

If someone sent 1 letter per day to their friend and each letter took a week to
get there, that would be high frequency and low latency.

## Volume

Volume is the amount of information being transferred between two people.
Please note that volume has a dependent relationship with other attributes.

A large volume of information necessitates longer latency. This is easy to see
by a quick example.

If someone handed you three large text books in a row, the frequency of
messages is fast and the volume is high but the latency might be different for
each book or even each chapter. You might read the first two chapters tonight
but it could take me a month to get to the last chapter of the last book.

This means volume has a dependent relationship with latency. This can be
negated with context dependent communication. See the section on context
dependent communication for more details.

## Ephemeral and Persistent

### Ephemeral Messages

Ephemeral communication is made up of messages that disappear or never have a
physical manifestation at all. When someone tell you something with their
voice, it's ephemeral because they won't be able to reference what they said
later unless what was said was remembered.

### Persistent Messages

Persistent communication is made up of messages that stick around. If someone
sends you a text message or an email you can later come back and view, audit or
reference the exact message that was sent.

Note: Ephemeral and persistent messages are, in many ways, a spectrum and should
not be seen as one or the other. 

## Context Dependent Messages & Shared Context

Context dependent messages are messages that don't send all of the information
required to communicate the desired principle but are still effective because
of shared context between the sender and receiver.

Imagine a scenario between Bob and Alice where Bob simply yells out Alice's
name across the office and Alice's response is "I'm on it!". From our outside
perspective there was nothing significantly communicated. However, we can also
tell that Alice understood what Bob was trying to say based on some context
they both share.

All communication is context dependent in some respect. The only reason you are
reading this right now is because of the shared context of the English language
that we share.
