# Introduce an Enterprise Search Tool

When critical system knowledge is locked away in the minds of a few tenured employees, bottlenecks are created, onboarding slows, and reliance on key personnel increases. Incomplete or outdated context will always lead to rework. An enterprise search tool like [Glean](https://www.glean.com/enterprise-search-software) or [Claude for Enterprise](https://claude.ai/login?returnTo=%2F%3F) unifies access to information across JIRA, Confluence, SVN, shared drives, and more. This allows teams to quickly find what they need without interrupting others or digging through multiple systems that require specialized knowledge.

## When to Experiment

“I am a new developer and I need to learn how to find accurate, updated documentation so I can onboard quickly and easily.”

“I am a QA team member and I need to ensure I have quick access to system knowledge so I can avoid wasting time sifting through multiple systems.”

“I am a developer and I need to ensure I have access to complete and up-to-date requirements so I can produce quality tickets and avoid QA rejections.”

“I am a senior team member and I need to ensure that specialized knowledge is accessible so I can reduce interruptions and boost team autonomy.”

## How to Gain Traction

<!-- TODO -->

List 3–5 steps to take a team from zero to adopted.
For each step, include:

### [Action Step]

3 sentences on how to do it, how to get buy-in, and what tools/resources help. Any external resources (videos, guides, book lists, templates, etc.) that help a team adopt this practice should be linked here within the relevant action step.

## Lessons From The Field

[Pragmint to complete]

This section captures real-world patterns (things that consistently help or hinder this practice) along with short, relevant stories from the field. It’s not for personal rants or generic opinions. Each entry must be based on either:
1. a repeated observation across teams, or
2. a specific example (what worked, what didn’t, and why).

## Deciding to Polish or Pitch

After experimenting with this practice for [insert appropriate quantity of time in bold], bring the team together to determine whether the following metrics and/or signals have changed in a positive direction:

### Fast & Measurable

Improved ticket quality and fewer QA rejections due to incomplete or unclear requirements

### Slow & Measurable

Increased self-service search usage, indicating trust and utility in the tool

Reduced onboarding time for new developers and QA (time to first merged PR or tested ticket)

### Slow & Intangible

Lower interruption load on senior team members (tracked by volume of support requests sent via Teams chat)

Fewer context-gathering delays in ticket implementation (measured via cycle time or qualitative developer feedback)

## Supported Capabilities

### [Learning Culture](https://github.com/pragmint/open-practices/blob/main/capabilities/learning-culture.md)) 

By centralizing institutional knowledge and making it accessible, enterprise search should boost team autonomy, reduce wasted time, and support a healthier learning culture.

### [Documentation Quality](https://github.com/pragmint/open-practices/blob/main/capabilities/documentation-quality.md))

Excellent documentation is accurate, clear, complete, and accessible to internal teams. This enables teams to effectively collaborate, make informed decisions, and deliver high-quality software quickly and reliably.
