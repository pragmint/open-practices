# Introduce a Screen-Recording Tool

An unfortunate reality is that tickets are often vague, lack clear acceptance criteria, or rely heavily on assumed knowledge. This leads to frequent misunderstandings, rework, and delays, particularly for newer team members who are unfamiliar with the system or business context. A lightweight screen-recording tool, like [Loom](https://www.loom.com/screen-recorder), allows ticket authors to quickly demonstrate the issue or desired behavior using voice and visuals, reducing ambiguity without adding process overhead.

## When to Experiment

“I am a developer and I need to ensure that my communication is intuitive so that I can document intent more clearly and reduce back-and-forth.”
"I am a developer and I need to learn how to write tickets quicker so that I can improve efficiency of handoffs."

## How to Gain Traction

List 3–5 steps to take a team from zero to adopted.
For each step, include:
  ### [Action Step]
  3 sentences on how to do it, how to get buy-in, and what tools/resources help. Any external resources (videos, guides, book lists, templates, etc.) that help a team adopt this practice should be linked here within the relevant action step.

## Lessons From The Field

[to be completed by Pragmint]

This section captures real-world patterns (things that consistently help or hinder this practice) along with short, relevant stories from the field. It’s not for personal rants or generic opinions. Each entry must be based on either:
1. a repeated observation across teams, or
2. a specific example (what worked, what didn’t, and why).

## Deciding to Polish or Pitch

After experimenting with this practice for [insert appropriate quantity of time in bold], bring the team together to determine whether the following metrics and/or signals have changed in a positive direction:

### Fast & Measurable

You should see **increased use of screen recordings in JIRA**, indicating the practice is gaining traction.

You should see a **reduction in synchronous clarification meetings**, freeing up time across roles.

You should see **faster lead time of tickets**.

### Slow & Measurable

You should see **fewer QA rejections or rework cycles** due to unclear requirements.

## Supported Capabilities
