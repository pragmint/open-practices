# Perform Automated Code Analysis

Manually spotting every potential bug, style inconsistency, or design flaw is a tall order — and often a slow one. Automated code analysis brings speed and consistency by having tools (both traditional static analyzers and modern AI-powered assistants) scan code as you work. These tools can highlight security vulnerabilities, style discrepancies, dependency risks, and even suggest or apply fixes in real time.

Some popular tools include:
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started) - General-purpose static analysis for JavaScript/TypeScript
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/integrating-with-linters) - Automated code formatting for JavaScript/TypeScript
- [SonarQube](https://www.sonarsource.com/sem/products/sonarqube/downloads/) - Multi-language static analysis with some AI-powered features
- [Semgrep](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep) - Multi-language static and semantic analysis, with AI-assisted rule generation
- [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) - AI-powered code review, style enforcement, and bug detection
- Self-hosted LLMs - Using tools like Ollama or LM Studio to run open-source AI models locally

## Who It’s For & Why

- You are a developer and would be need feedback on potential bugs, design issues, and style mismatches without waiting for a review cycle.
- You are a QA Engineer and you need to identify high risk areas earlier in the development process, so you can identify the best use of your often limited testing time ensuring greater code quality.
- You are a Tech Lead or Manager and you need to ensure consistent code quality across a team without increasing review overhead.

## Goals, Metrics & Signals

### Intended Outcomes

- Faster detection and resolution of bugs, security vulnerabilities, and style inconsistencies.
- Increased developer confidence and reduced rework caused by late-discovered issues.
- Improved consistency and maintainability across the codebase.

### Target Measurements

- Reduced number of issues caught during manual code reviews that could have been flagged by automated tools.
- Decrease in production bugs linked to preventable coding errors.
- Positive changes in developer sentiment around “friction” in code reviews, measured via retrospectives or surveys.


## Lessons From The Field

- *Automation Should Complement, Not Replace Human Review* – Automated tools are great at spotting patterns but can miss context-specific problems. Keep human judgment in the loop.
- *False Positives Can Cause Fatigue* – Too many non-issues flagged will erode trust in the tool. Customize rulesets and adjust sensitivity over time.
- *Makes Tight Coupling Easier* - When you make it easier to write code that changes multiple parts of the broader system, you make it easier to introduce code that doesn't separate concerns and increases module coupling. This can be mitigated with constant retrospectives focused on how these boundaries are formed. The good news about monorepos is when you identify a poorly constructed boundary, it's easier to fix when it's all in the same repo.
- *AI Tools Can Provide Richer Feedback* – LLM-powered assistants can understand broader context and suggest better-structured fixes, but may occasionally “hallucinate” incorrect solutions — always verify.
- *Integrate Into the Workflow Early* – The earlier developers see issues (e.g., in their IDE), the less disruptive they are to fix.
- *Use the Right Tool for the Right Job* – Some tools shine in specific languages or environments; a multi-tool approach often works best.

## How to Gain Traction

### Run a Pilot on a Single Repo

Choose one active repository, integrate one or two automated analysis tools (both a static analyzer and, optionally, an AI assistant). Measure how quickly developers address flagged issues and collect feedback.

### Optimize Rules and Feedback Loops

Start with default rules, then refine based on false positive rates and team feedback. Set up CI/CD hooks or pre-commit checks to keep quality gates lightweight but effective.

### Expand Across Teams

After a successful pilot, share results and best practices. Provide setup guides and starter configs. Consider hosting internal workshops to help developers get the most from the tools.

## Supporting Capabilities

### [Code Maintainability](/capabilities/code-maintainability.md)

Automated analysis enforces consistent coding standards and identifies maintainability issues early, keeping the codebase clean and approachable.

### [Pervasive Security](/capabilities/pervasive-security.md)

Static and AI-powered analysis can surface vulnerabilities before code is merged, helping meet security and compliance requirements.

### [Job Satisfaction](/capabilities/job-satisfaction.md)

Real-time feedback in editors and pull requests reduces context switching and increases developer confidence which will lend to more job satisfaction and less costly employee turnover.
