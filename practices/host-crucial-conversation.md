# Host a Crucial Conversation

By hosting a crucial conversation, you're helping team members with differing (sometimes strong) opinions navigate high-stakes and sensitive discussions. You're also helping to strengthen relationships and build trust within your team.
The key to hosting a crucial conversation is creating a space of psychological safety, where participants can speak openly and without fear of judgment or conflict. This opens the door to constructive feedback, civil conflict resolution, and collaborative decision-making where team members are working toward a common goal.
For a team of software developers, a crucial conversation might center around deciding whether to refactor a legacy system or invest in building a new one. This discussion could involve balancing the technical debt, budget constraints, and the potential impact on delivery timelines. Another example might involve debating the adoption of test-driven development (TDD) as a standard practice, weighing its potential to improve code quality against concerns about increased development time.
With the help of a host, these difficult discussions can be turned into opportunities for growth.

## Nuances

This section outlines common pitfalls, challenges, or limitations teams commonly encounter when applying this practice. The goal here is not to discourage you. Rather, the goal is to arm you with the appropriate context so that you can make an informed decision about when and how to implement the practice with your teams.

### Fool's Choice

The fool's choice arises when, during a difficult conversation, people think they must choose between being honest and preserving a relationship. They fear that speaking openly will cause harm or conflict. But the fool's choice is a false dilemma. It's also counterproductive, typically leading to silence or aggression and damaging trust. A _third option_ exists: addressing issues respectfully while maintaining the relationship. As host, remember this third option and focus on articulating shared goals and fostering a safe environment.

### You have to keep an open mind

It's important to enter a crucial conversation with a genuine curiosity about the other person's perspective. Without this, participants limit their ability to truly understand the underlying issues and unique viewpoints. An open mind allows them to consider different angles, question assumptions, and explore the conversation more deeply. By encouraging participants to remain curious, you create a more constructive environment for dialogue, fostering empathy and collaboration. You're also helping your team find common ground and work toward a resolution that benefits all parties to some degree.

### Stay Focused

During a crucial conversation, it can be challenging to maintain a single point of focus, especially if the discussion becomes uncomfortable. In these moments, individuals may bring up unrelated issues to divert attention from the primary topic, which can derail the conversation and lead to confusion. As a host, _bookmarking_ is a crucial strategy to employ here — this involves consciously noting unrelated issues for later discussion, so they don’t distract from the conversation at hand.

### Full Consensus May Not Be Feasible

A common misconception is that all decisions — especially those made during crucial conversations — should be made by consensus. But the belief that full agreement is always necessary can lead to compromises and delays. In urgent situations, or when decisions affect a larger group, full consensus may not be feasible. Here are some alternatives to consensus that offer quicker and more flexible decision-making:

* Command: Decisions are made without involving others.
* Consultation: Input is gathered from stakeholders and a smaller group makes the final decision.
* Voting: Decisions are made based on a majority agreement.

## Gaining Traction

The following actions will help your team implement this practice.

### Lead Workshops

#### Host a mock crucial conversation

Hosting a mock crucial conversation involves your team role-playing in a challenging conversation to practice managing emotions and communicating effectively. Begin by identifying a shared purpose. What is the focus of the conversation and what is the common goal that all participants are working toward? One group then simulates scenarios like giving feedback or resolving conflicts, while another group observes and critiques. Afterward, the entire group reflects on the experience to improve future real-life conversations. As host, it's helpful to use the Crucial Conversations [worksheet](https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/25ad169b/files/uploaded/Crucial-Conversations-Worksheet.pdf) to guide the mock conversation, ensuring that key strategies and goals are addressed throughout the exercise.

Hosting a mock crucial conversation will help your team build skills such as active listening, staying calm under pressure, and navigating sensitive or high-stakes issues.
