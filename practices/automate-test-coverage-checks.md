# Automate Test Coverage Checks

Automating test coverage ensures there is a baseline of test coverage for your software.
Following this practice won't guarantee the quality or reliability of your tests. As such, it's not a sufficient check by itself.
Nevertheless, it's usually a low-cost way to spot gaps in your codebase's test coverage.
Integrating these checks into CI pipelines ensures continuous validation without slowing down development.

## Nuance

### Coverage Metrics vs. Test Quality

It's important to prioritize the quality of tests over coverage percentages.
Teams may focus solely on increasing coverage numbers without ensuring that tests are effective in catching bugs and edge cases.

### Balancing Speed and Coverage

While automating test coverage checks speeds up validation processes, overemphasizing coverage goals can lead to diminishing returns.
Setting overly ambitious coverage targets may slow down development or lead to superficial tests that don't add substantial value.
It's important to strike a balance between achieving sufficient coverage and maintaining a productive development pace.

### Non-Functional Test Considerations

Automated test coverage often focuses on functional aspects of software, such as correctness and behavior.
However, neglecting non-functional tests—like performance, security, and usability—can leave important aspects of automated test quality out.
Integrating non-functional tests into automated pipelines ensures comprehensive software validation.
For instance, performance tests can identify bottlenecks, security tests can detect vulnerabilities, and usability tests can improve user experience.
None of those types of tests fit neatly into a traditional "coverage" check.

### Continuous Improvement

Automating test coverage checks should not be a one-time setup but an ongoing process of refinement and improvement.
Teams should regularly review and adjust coverage thresholds based on evolving project requirements, feedback from testing outcomes, and changes in software functionality.### [Host A Roundtable Discussion](/practices/host-a-roundtable-discussion.md)

## How to Improve

### [Start A Book Club](/practices/start-a-book-club.md)

#### [Test Coverage](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestCoverage.html)

In his blog post on test coverage, Martin Fowler explores the concept of test coverage as a tool for identifying untested code rather than as a definitive measure of test quality.
He argues that while high test coverage percentages can highlight which parts of the code are exercised by tests, they do not necessarily indicate the effectiveness of those tests.
Fowler emphasizes that test coverage should be used alongside other techniques and metrics to assess the robustness of tests, and that focusing solely on coverage numbers can lead to superficial or inadequate testing.
He advocates for a balanced approach that combines test coverage with thoughtful test design and evaluation to achieve meaningful software quality.

#### Tailoring and Adjusting Test Coverage

* Are our current coverage thresholds realistic and tailored to the specific needs of different modules within our application?
* How often do we review and adjust our coverage metrics to align with evolving project requirements?

#### Effectiveness of Test Coverage

* Do our tests catch bugs and edge cases, or are they merely boosting our coverage numbers?
* Are we adequately addressing non-functional testing, such as performance, security, and usability, in our automated test coverage?

#### Challenges and Lessons in Test Coverage Implementation

* Are there any cultural or organizational barriers that prevent us from fully implementing this practice?
* What lessons can we learn from past experiences to enhance our future approach to automated test coverage?

## Supporting Capabilities

### [Test Automation](/capabilities/test-automation.md)

Automating test coverage checks supports the Test Automation capability by ensuring continuous and immediate feedback on code changes within the CI pipeline.
This practice identifies untested code early, helping prevent bugs and regressions, and aligns with a consistent testing strategy.
By maintaining realistic coverage thresholds for different modules, it optimizes testing efforts, enhances collaboration between testers and developers, and ultimately improves software quality and stability throughout the delivery lifecycle.
