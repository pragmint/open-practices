# Making A Contribution

Thanks for considering making a contribution to our repository! We welcome new ideas and appreciate your willingness to share your experience with us. While this is a general purpose repository, it is associated with Pragmint's brand. Therefore, we reserve the right to reject contributions if our experiences don't support the suggestions.

We have three main types of pages contained in this repository:

1. **Capability** - A proficiency that elite-level teams possess, which helps them deliver reliable software systems quickly. Capability pages explain both what to do (at a high level) and why to do it. These capabilities are defined by the [DORA research team](https://dora.dev/). We summarize their findings and add context as deemed appropriate.
2. **Practice** - An actionable pattern, technique, or process employed by software professionals. Each practice page provides ideas for implementing a capability at a more granular level. For example, running pair programming sessions is a practice teams can use to help implement the Code Maintainability capability. Not every practice is a good idea for every team. Each practice supports one or more DORA capabilities.
3. **Resource** - Reference material that provides additional context, guidance, or support for understanding and implementing a practice. Resources may include articles, books, videos, workshops, code katas, roundtable discussion points, etc. Generally, resource pages expand on the underlying _how_ behind practices.

We are looking for contributions in the following areas:

1. New practices.
2. New resources.
3. Feedback on our existing practices or any ideas presented in this repo.
4. Additional content to illustrate to our readers how a capability, practice, or resource can be beneficial.
5. Additional content describing common pitfalls, challenges, or limitations teams commonly encounter when applying certain practices or capabilities.
6. Typos or grammatical fixes.

If you chose to contribute a new practice or resource, please try to follow our pre-established structure. We've created templates with guided instructions so you can more easily make a contribution. You can check them out in the [templates directory](/templates/).
