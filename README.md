# Open Practices

> Practice - A specific, repeatable action or technique that software professionals use to improve how they build and deliver software. 

Welcome to Pragmint’s Open Practices repository. Here, you will find a library of proven techniques and high-impact practices — all open-souced and ready to apply today — that will elevate your team and drive better business results.

Material in this repository supports Pragmint’s cyclical **S.T.E.P.** strategy:

* **Survey:** Use our [open-source assessment](/capabilities-maturity-assessment.md) to objectively measure your team’s maturity against the 29 [DORA Capabilities](https://github.com/pragmint/open-practices/tree/main/capabilities). 

* **Target:** Identify Capabilities where there are significant gaps in adoption, and prioritize improving on those that will deliver the highest impact. 

* **Experiment:** Play around with supported [practices](https://github.com/pragmint/open-practices/tree/main/practices) to enhance targeted Capabilities. Select one or two high-impact experiments, commit to them, and give the team time to integrate them into their regular workflow.

* **Polish:** After a few months of experimenting, gather feedback to reflect and reassess progress. Review Metrics & Signals, included in each [practice](https://github.com/pragmint/open-practices/tree/main/practices), to determine whether an experiment is making a positive impact. Refine practices that are working, scrap those that are not, and continue to adapt based on real-world feedback and measurements for success.

At [Pragmint](https://pragmint.com/), we rely on this resource to onboard new team members and focus our [Co-Dev Coaching](https://www.pragmint.com/insight/what-is-co-dev-coaching) efforts.

## Important Note

Reading and learning alone won't create lasting change. It's important to experiment with each practice. Each team has a different mix of skills, experiences, and constraints. So, a one-size-fits-all approach tends to feel heavyweight. It's helpful to set time aside to earnestly experiment with new practices, then keep what works and throw out what doesn't. Understand that just because a practice doesn't work for one team doesn't mean it has no value for other teams. Our goal with this repository is to list practices that tend to work for most teams.

If you're a tech leader, exposing your teams to this resource may be a helpful first step for them. However, certain teams may be less experienced or less willing to experiment, leading to a lack of lasting change. In those cases, you may want to consider starting a [Co-Dev Coaching](https://www.pragmint.com/insight/what-is-co-dev-coaching) practice of your own. [Pragmint](https://pragmint.com/) can help.
