# Open Practices

> prac·tice (noun): a defined and repeatable way of working (like a play in a team's playbook) that is used to align teammates and improve software delivery.

Welcome to [Pragmint](https://pragmint.com)'s Open Practices repository. Here, you will find the library of practices that Pragmint's [Co-Dev Coaches](https://www.pragmint.com/insight/what-is-co-dev-coaching) draw from when helping client software and data engineering teams level up. These practices aren’t rigid rules or one-size-fits-all solutions; they’re approaches that have proven effective for Pragmint in many situations. Every team and context is different, but understanding the practices that _usually_ work provides a solid starting point. Think of this repo as a playbook: a set of plays you can adapt, remix, or experiment with to fit your own game.

Each of these practices maps to one or more [DORA capabilities](#dora-capabilities) listed below. We use the DORA research as a backbone because it’s the most widely validated body of evidence connecting engineering practices to measurable delivery performance. It provides a common language for assessing where teams stand today and clarity on which improvements actually move the needle. By linking our practices to DORA's capabilities, we make it easier to see not just what to try, but also why it matters and how it contributes to the bigger picture of high-performing software delivery.

Material in this repository supports Pragmint's cyclical **S.T.E.P.** framework:

* **Survey:** Use our [open-source assessment](/capabilities-maturity-assessment.md) to measure your team's maturity against the 29 DORA Capabilities.

* **Target:** Identify Capabilities where there are significant gaps in adoption, and prioritize improving on those that will deliver the highest impact.

* **Experiment:** Play around with supported [practices](/practices) to enhance targeted Capabilities. Select one or two high-impact experiments, commit to them, and give the team time to integrate them into their regular workflow.

* **Polish:** Gather feedback and reflect on how experimenting with one or more practices affected the team's or system's performance. Review Metrics & Signals, included in each practice ([example](/practices/migrate-to-monorepo.md#metrics--signals)), to determine whether an experiment is making a positive impact. Adopt practices that are working, refine or scrap those that are not, then take the next S.T.E.P.
