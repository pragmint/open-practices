# [Test Automation](https://dora.dev/capabilities/test-automation/)

Test automation is essential for building high-quality software. It provides early feedback in the software delivery lifecycle, reduces team burnout, and reduces deployment challenges. While manual testing is an essential part of every testing plan, it can be inefficient and unreliable, leading to missed bugs and delayed feedback.

There are many types of automated tests, each with their own benefits and limitations. The most valuable test suites are made up of multiple layers, following a pyramid-like structure (see [Testing Pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html)). This way, the systems under test get a thorough and reliable check every time the test suite is run.

## Nuances

This section outlines common pitfalls, challenges, or limitations teams commonly encounter when applying this capability. The goal here is not to discourage you. Rather, the goal is to arm you with the appropriate context so that you can make an informed decision about when and how to implement the capability with your teams.

### Potential Cultural Resistance

In some organizations, test automation is sometimes undervalued due to gaps in awareness or experience with effective test design. Code that is structured for testability is often easier to maintain and higher quality, but developing the skill to write such code takes time and practice. According to DORA's findings, teams that value automated, developer-led testing experience less friction in the testing process and benefit from higher overall performance.

### Testing Is A Whole Team Responsibility

Testing is a shared responsibility and a core part of the development process—not a gate at the end.
High-performing teams treat testing as a first-class activity that spans design, development, and delivery. While QA specialists bring deep expertise in test strategy and exploratory testing, developers own the quality of their code and maintain comprehensive automated test suites. Product managers and designers contribute by ensuring that critical user journeys and edge cases are clearly defined, prioritized, and testable. Rather than silo testing within QA, the entire team collaborates to catch issues early, reduce feedback loops, and build confidence in every release. The goal isn't just to prevent defects—it's to create a culture where quality is baked in from the start.

### Automation Isn't Meant To Replace Manual Testing

Test automation is _not_ a substitute for manual testing. Rather, automated testing _complements_ manual testing. It helps reduce the repetitive and time-consuming aspects of manually verifying system correctness. Each test carries its own cost-benefit ratio, and attempting to cover 100% of a system with automation can lead to high maintenance costs and, at times, a false sense of security. Instead, the team's focus should be on automating routine checks and creating automated tests that catch critical bugs early, reserving manual testing for more exploratory and edge-case scenarios.

### Flaky Tests

Flaky tests are tests that fail intermittently for reasons unrelated to code changes. The "piling up" of flaky tests erode trust in automated testing and slow down delivery, as teams must investigate whether failures are true defects or false positives. Addressing flaky tests promptly and thoroughly improves team confidence in the test suite and enables faster releases.

### Imbalanced Test Pyramid

Over-reliance on slower acceptance tests instead of faster unit tests can result in longer feedback cycles and increased maintenance costs. An ideal test pyramid should have a larger proportion of unit tests that catch issues in pinpointed areas of the codebase early, followed by fewer acceptance and end-to-end tests that catch issues in the broader system. Ensuring a balanced test pyramid reduces the cost and complexity of test automation.

## Assessment

To assess how mature your team or organization is in this capability, complete this short exercise.

Consider the descriptions below and score yourself on the Test Automation capability. Generally, score a 1 if Test Automation is limited or completely lacking from your team or organization, a 2 if it is basic and you feel there is a LOT of room for improvement, a 3 if it is mature and you feel there is some room for improvement, and a 4 if your team or organization is exemplary in the area of Test Automation.

Don't worry if the description doesn't exactly match your situation. These descriptions are meant to be examples of situations that would qualify for the associated score.

1. **Limited:** Test automation is minimal, slow, and/or unreliable. There is heavy reliance on manual testing.
2. **Basic:** Test automation is somewhat reliable, but is either slow or has gaps in coverage and/or value. Manual testing is required to achieve high levels of confidence.
3. **Mature:** Test automation is reliable, fast, and valuable, with good risk coverage. Occasional gaps are still discovered.
4. **Optimized:** Test automation provides a high degree of assurance that code changes are correct, stable, and won't introduce significant issues if deployed to production. It provides this assurance quickly and reliably.

The number you selected represents your overall score for this capability. If you feel like your team or organization fits somewhere in between two scores, it's okay to use a decimal. For example, if you think your team or organization has somewhere between basic and mature Test Automation, then you would score a 2.5.

Generally, an overall score equal to or less than 3 means you'll likely gain a lot of value from experimenting with some of the supporting practices listed here. An overall score higher than 3 generally means you and your team are largely proficient, or well on your way to becoming proficient, in the area of Test Automation; you would likely benefit from evaluating your scores in other capabilities.

## Supporting Practices

The following is a curated list of supporting practices to consider when looking to improve your team's Test Automation capability. While not every practice will be beneficial in every situation, this list is meant to provide teams with fresh, pragmatic, and actionable ideas to support this capability.

### [Build a Consistent Testing Strategy](/practices/build-consistent-testing-strategy.md)

Building a consistent testing strategy means providing a structured approach to testing that aligns with project needs.
It emphasizes balanced test coverage, integrates tests into CI pipelines for fast feedback, and combines automated and manual testing to ensure comprehensive quality and stability of software.

### [Automate Test Coverage Checks](/practices/automate-test-coverage-checks.md)

Automating test coverage checks ensures continuous and immediate feedback on code changes within the CI pipeline.
This practice identifies untested code early, helping prevent bugs and regressions, and aligns with a consistent testing strategy.
By maintaining realistic coverage thresholds for different modules, automating test coverage checks optimizes testing efforts, enhances collaboration between testers and developers, and ultimately improves software quality and stability throughout the delivery lifecycle.

### [Conduct Code Reviews](/practices/conduct-code-reviews.md)

Code reviews allow team members to ensure that proposed code is functional and easy to maintain over time. This practice also promotes test automation, prevents regression errors, and maintains smooth CI processes. By providing feedback on readability, test coverage, and coding standards adherence, conducting code reviews improves the quality of the codebase and the stability of the software.

### [Create and Manage Ephemeral Environments](/practices/create-and-manage-ephemeral-environments.md)

Creating and managing ephemeral environments provides flexible, production-like testing setups that ensure automated tests are reliable and accurate.
These temporary environments reduce conflicts, simplify debugging, and improve reproducibility.
Integrated into CI/CD pipelines, they offer continuous, immediate feedback on code changes, promoting early bug detection and robust software quality.

### [Follow Functional Core, Imperative Shell](/practices/follow-functional-core-imperative-shell.md)

The Functional Core, Imperative Shell pattern involves separating business logic into a functional core and side effects into an imperative shell. With a clear distinction between pure functions and imperative code, developers can more easily write testable and maintainable code. This enhances the stability and maintainability of the system. It also simplifies the testing process, improves test coverage, and provides faster and more reliable feedback during development.

### [Implement Test-Driven Development](/practices/implement-tdd.md)

Implementing Test-Driven Development (TDD) means integrating rigorous testing directly into the development process.
TDD mandates writing tests _before_ coding, which ensures early bug detection and promotes better software design through continuous refactoring.
By following the red-green-refactor cycle, and principles like Transformation Priority Premise and [F. I. R. S. T.](https://dzone.com/articles/first-principles-solid-rules-for-tests), teams can build simple and reliable systems.

## Adjacent Capabilities

The following capabilities will be valuable for you and your team to explore, as they are either:

* Related (they cover similar territory to Test Automation)
* Upstream (they are a pre-requisite for Test Automation)
* Downstream (Test Automation is a pre-requisite for them)

### [Test Data Management](/capabilities/test-data-management.md) - Upstream

Some types of test automation -- such as e2e, performance, and load -- rely on data to run their assertions. That's why it's important for teams to have a mature test data management capability _before_ setting up data-reliant automated tests.

### [Continuous Integration](/capabilities/continuous-integration.md) - Downstream

In order for a CI pipeline to know what changes to accept and what changes to reject, it must rely on automated tests. A robust, fast-running, and automated test suite ensures changes can be verified continuously. The less reliable a test suite is, the more manual interventions are required and the less continuous changes can be integrated.

### [Streamline Change Approval](/capabilities/streamline-change-approval.md) - Downstream

With robust test automation in place, teams can approve changes with confidence, knowing they have a reliable safeguard to catch errors and ensure system stability. Reviewers can focus on strategic and functional aspects of the change, rather than worrying about technical integrity, since certain categories of potential errors have already been identified and addressed via automated tests.

### [Code Maintainability](/capabilities/code-maintainability.md) - Related

Test automation can offer valuable insights into code maintainability. Code that is easy to test is often better organized, more maintainable, and resilient. When developers struggle to write automated tests, it can serve as a signal that the code may need restructuring or refinement. This feedback loop from test automation helps teams improve code quality over time, enhancing both testability and long-term maintainability.
