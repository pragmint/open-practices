# [Generative Organizational Culture](https://dora.dev/capabilities/generative-organizational-culture/)

A Generative Organizational Culture is characterized by high cooperation and trust, free flow of information, and an emphasis on performance and continuous learning. In such a culture, teams are encouraged to take risks, embrace failures as learning opportunities, and implement new ideas.

A cornerstone of Generative Organizational Cultures is *transparency*. Leaders can model transparent behavior by talking openly with their teams about decisions, context, and rationale, ensuring information is presented in a way that is actionable for diverse audiences. Tools like asynchronous updates, decision logs, and team dashboards can make information accessible but not overwhelming. Effective transparency fosters collaboration, enables feedback, and ensures teams feel empowered to contribute.

## Nuances

This section outlines common pitfalls, challenges, or limitations teams commonly encounter when applying this capability. The goal here is not to discourage you. Rather, the goal is to arm you with the appropriate context so that you can make an informed decision about when and how to implement the capability with your teams.

### Informal Networks Impact Information Flow

Personal relationships and informal networks play a significant role in how information flows within organizations. For example, if someone from Team A is close friends with someone from Team B, information is likely to flow freely between the two. In contrast, teams with no such personal connections may struggle with communication, even if their collaboration is formally mandated.

### Lack of Trust is a Limiting Factor

When there is a lack of trust between decision-makers and team members, valuable information often gets ignored as team members are more likely to stop sharing context. For example, if engineers spot a product flaw but don't trust their warnings will be taken seriously, they might avoid raising concerns, leading to mis-informed executive decision-making. Trust-building is a long-term process but is critical for enabling high-functioning, performance-oriented, generative cultures.

### Centralized and Decentralized Structures Each Have Trade-Offs

Both centralized and decentralized organizational structures can be generative. However, each structure has distinct strengths and challenges.

Decentralized structures, where a lot of decision-making happens at lower levels of the organization, enable lower-level managers and developers to use their specialized knowledge, and encourage them to acquire more information. However, these structures can lead to misalignment with broader organizational objectives and hinder coordination across divisions.

Centralized structures, where solutions are generally pre-determined at a higher level, ensure better goal alignment and resource allocation, as well as consistency, but insights are often lost due to communication barriers.

One structure is not better than the other; the use of one over the other depends on what you're optimizing for. An organization may be centralized in some ways (for example, in strategic decision-making) but decentralized in others (for example, in technology choice). The goal is to achieve balance in your organization's structure by carefully evaluating its needs.

### Problem and Skill Matching

Effective problem and skill matching is foundational for a generative culture. Misaligned tasks can lead to delays, inefficiencies, and low morale, undermining trust and collaboration. By aligning problems with expertise, teams can solve challenges effectively, learn from failures, and innovate together.

### Changing Culture Takes Time

Transitioning to a Generative Organizational Culture is not an overnight process. As with trust-building, cultural change requires sustained effort and commitment from all levels of the organization. It involves altering ingrained behaviors and mindsets, which can be challenging and met with resistance. Recognizing that this transformation is a long-term investment is crucial for success.

## Assessment

To assess how mature your team or organization is in this capability, complete this short exercise.

Consider the descriptions below and score yourself on the Generative Organizational Culture capability. Generally, score a 1 if your organization's culture is top-down, a 2 if it is bureaucratic and you feel there is a lot of room for improvement, a 3 if it is collaborative and you feel there is some room for improvement, and a 4 if your organization exemplifies a generative culture.

Don't worry if the description doesn't exactly match your situation. These descriptions are meant to be examples of situations that would qualify for the associated score.

1. Top-Down: Teams operate under a highly directive approach, with leadership providing explicit instructions and priorities. Autonomy for decision-making is limited. In the event of failure, the focus is on individual accountability and administering corrective action.
2. Bureaucratic: Teams follow established procedures and protocols, with clear roles and responsibilities. Sometimes the specific instructions are vague or incomplete with no clear product leader. Teams have some flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances. However, leadership approval is still required for most meaningful decisions.
3. Collaborative: Teams seek input and expertise from other teams to inform their decisions, but maintain clear ownership and responsibility for their work. Each team has some autonomy to make decisions within established boundaries. However, strategic direction is set by leadership, and teams are expected to align their work with these top-down priorities.
4. Generative: Teams seek input and expertise from other teams to inform their decisions, but maintain clear ownership and responsibility for their work. Each team has some autonomy to make decisions within established boundaries. Strategic direction is set by leadership, but factors in ground-level feedback from the teams.

The number you selected represents your overall score for this capability. If you feel like your organization fits somewhere in between two scores, it's okay to use a decimal. For example, if you think your organization's culture is somewhere between bureaucratic and collaborative, you would score a 2.5.

Generally, an overall score equal to or less than 3 means you'll likely gain a lot of value from experimenting with some of the supporting practices listed here. An overall score higher than 3 generally means your organization is largely proficient, or well on its way to becoming proficient, in the area of Generative Organizational Culture; you would likely benefit from evaluating your scores in other capabilities.

## Supporting Practices

The following is a curated list of supporting practices to consider when looking to improve your team's Generative Organizational Culture capability. While not every practice will be beneficial in every situation, this list is meant to provide teams with fresh, pragmatic, and actionable ideas to support this capability.

### Conduct Blameless Retrospectives

After any incident or failure, organize a postmortem meeting where the focus is on *understanding the root causes* rather than assigning blame. Encourage all team members to openly share insights and perspectives to learn from the event. By treating failures as opportunities for inquiry and learning, teams can feel empowered to improve processes and prevent future issues, enhancing organizational trust and collaboration.

### Host Skip-Level 1:1s

Skip-level 1:1s create a direct channel for information flow, regardless of one's status in the organization. They provide a safe space for employees to share concerns, ideas, and feedback with their manager's manager or another high-level leader. They also demonstrate to employees that their voices are valued, giving them a sense of empowerment and autonomy. The goal is to foster open communication and build trust across the organization. By listening to employees' concerns, leaders can identify and address potential issues before they escalate, reducing turnover and improving job satisfaction. Leaders can also offer guidance, mentorship, and opportunities for growth, aligning employees' goals with organizational objectives. 

### Train Your Team To Have Crucial Conversations

A crucial conversation is a high-stakes discussion where differing opinions and strong emotions must be handled carefully to achieve constructive outcomes. These conversations foster open communication, trust, and psychological safety, ensuring that concerns and conflicts are addressed directly. By promoting shared accountability and learning from mistakes, crucial conversations enhance collaboration and drive continuous improvement across teams.

### Rotate Team Members Routinely

Routinely rotating team members exposes them to new roles, challenges, and perspectives, fostering collaboration and breaking down silos. This practice encourages knowledge sharing, builds empathy, and brings fresh ideas to teams — all of which help drive innovation and adaptability. Team rotations support the high cooperation and shared responsibility that define a Generative Organizational Culture.

### Allocate Time To Have Fun And Build Strong Relationships

Allocating time for fun and relationship-building fosters trust, collaboration, and a sense of belonging among team members. When employees can share positive experiences, it strengthens psychological safety, boosts creativity, and encourages cross-team connections. These elements not only make the workplace more enjoyable but also encourage retention and productivity by signaling that the organization values its employees' well-being. An organization that balances productivity with meaningful relationships creates an environment where employees thrive.

### Establish Cross-Functional Teams

Aim to create teams that are composed of members from different functional areas in the organization, such as development, operations, quality assurance, and security. This structure promotes high cooperation, knowledge sharing, and shared responsibility throughout the software delivery lifecycle. By bridging gaps between departments, organizations can improve information flow and reduce silos, leading to informed decision-making, better performance, and strong innovation.

### Use Open Communication Platforms

Adopt tools and platforms that facilitate transparent and easy communication across the organization, such as chat systems, collaborative documentation, and shared dashboards. Encourage the sharing of information, questions, and updates openly and regularly rather than through isolated channels and in narrow timeframes. By improving information flow, teams are better informed and can respond more effectively to changes and challenges.

### [Visualize All Work on a Storyboard](/practices/visualize-all-work-on-a-storyboard.md) - Related

Building a storyboard through a cross-functional VSM workshop creates space for team members to hear each other's challenges and see how their work connects. When developers learn what blocks QA, or product discovers how much time goes to incident response, empathy and trust grow. This shared understanding shifts the culture from finger-pointing to collaborative problem-solving.
