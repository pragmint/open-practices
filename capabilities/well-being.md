# [Well-Being](https://dora.dev/capabilities/well-being/)

Well-Being focuses on the overall physical, mental, and emotional health of employees. DORA has found a compelling link between well-being and three factors: deployment pain, rework, and burnout.

Deployment pain refers to the amount of effort it takes to safely apply changes to live environments. The more "pain" developers experience, the lower their well-being tends to be.

Rework is any unplanned work that arises as a result of low software quality. Rework does NOT include refactoring that's done as a routine part of the development process. The more rework developers are required to do, the lower their well-being tends to be.

According to [Dr. Christina Maslach](https://psychology.berkeley.edu/people/christina-maslach), burnout is physical or mental exhaustion that results from one of the following: work overload, lack of control, insufficient rewards, a breakdown of community, the absence of fairness, or value conflicts between an individual and the organization they work for. The more an individual feels burnout, the lower their well-being tends to be.

High levels of well-being predict better organizational performance and increased employee retention.

## Nuances

This section outlines common pitfalls, challenges, or limitations teams commonly encounter when applying this capability. The goal here is not to discourage you. Rather, the goal is to arm you with the appropriate context so that you can make an informed decision about when and how to implement the capability with your teams.

### Repetitive Work Creates Burnout

There's a strong link between individuals who are assigned repetitive or toilsome work and those who are feeling burnt out. Not all work is going to be novel and interesting, so it's important that this work gets done. It's likely worth trying to automate (where effective and practical) those tasks or at least spreading out the workload across the team. That way no team members wind up bearing the brunt of that challenge.

### Rework is Inevitable

No matter how hard a team tries, there is always going to be rework. The goal shouldn't be to eliminate rework through quality. That can lead to a warped cost/value assessment of potential investments in quality. Taking a pragmatic approach and instead attempting to reduce unreasonable amounts of rework through incremental investments in quality is more likely to yield a strong return to team productivity.

## Supporting Practices

The following is a curated list of supporting practices to consider when looking to improve your team's Job Satisfaction capability. While not every practice will be beneficial in every situation, this list is meant to provide teams with fresh, pragmatic, and actionable ideas to support this capability.

### Track Employee Engagement

Designing and routinely sending out an employee engagement survey that fits your organization's culture ([helpful guidelines](https://hbr.org/2002/02/getting-the-truth-into-workplace-surveys)) can uncover issues affecting employee well-being and organization performance. These surveys can be great tools for listening, understanding, and fostering a culture of improvement. If this data is widely shared and acted upon, it can show employees that their input can drive meaningful change.

### Host Skip-Level 1:1s

Skip-level 1:1s create a direct channel for information flow, regardless of one's status in the organization. They provide a safe space for employees to share concerns, ideas, and feedback with their manager's manager or another high-level leader. They also demonstrate to employees that their voices are valued, giving them a sense of empowerment and autonomy. The goal is to foster open communication and build trust across the organization. By listening to employees' concerns, leaders can identify and address potential issues before they escalate, reducing turnover and improving job satisfaction. Leaders can also offer guidance, mentorship, and opportunities for growth, aligning employees' goals with organizational objectives.

### Implement Employee Recognition Programs

Establish structured programs to recognize employees for their contributions and achievements. This could include monthly awards, public acknowledgments during team meetings, a digital "kudos" board, or personalized appreciation notes. Share specific examples of outstanding work or helpful behaviors. By promoting a culture of appreciation and peer-to-peer acknowledgment, team morale and motivation improve significantly.

### Allocate Time To Have Fun and Build Strong Relationships

Allocating time for fun and relationship-building fosters trust, collaboration, and a sense of belonging among team members. When employees can share positive experiences, it strengthens psychological safety, boosts creativity, and encourages cross-team connections. These elements not only make the workplace more enjoyable but also encourage retention and productivity by signaling that the organization values its employees' well-being. An organization that balances productivity with meaningful relationships creates an environment where employees thrive.

### Start a Community of Practice

Starting a community of practice means providing a dedicated space where a variety of practices (like demonstrations, workshops, book clubs, etc.) can be performed. This collaborative environment fosters continuous learning, sharing of best practices, and collective problem-solving. By bringing together practitioners with shared interests, a community of practice can drive innovation, enhance skills, and promote a learning culture. This sense of connection and growth empowers employees to feel fulfilled and invested in their work.

### Automate Deployment Scripts

Develop scripts that automate the entire deployment process, including environment preparation, package deployment, configuration, and post-deployment testing. By scripting these steps, you eliminate manual interventions and reduce the risk of human error. This leads to a repeatable and reliable deployment process that can be triggered with minimal effort, enhancing deployment speed and consistency.

### Incorporate Anomaly Detection Tooling

To avoid having to manually verify systems are working in production after a deployment, incorporate tooling that flags anomalies in your system's various environments. Examples of this include: reporting spikes in compute or network resources, reporting new error level log events, A/B testing two versions of a system with the same traffic, running automated user acceptance tests, etc.

## Adjacent Capabilities

The following capabilities will be valuable for you and your team to explore, as they are either:

- Related (they cover similar territory to Well-Being)
- Upstream (they are a pre-requisite for Well-Being)
- Downstream (Well-Being is a pre-requisite for them)

### [Job Satisfaction](/capabilities/job-satisfaction.md) - Related

Job Satisfaction is closely linked to well-being, as it reflects how content individuals are with their roles and work environment. When employees are satisfied with their jobs, they are more likely to experience higher levels of well-being. Focusing on factors that improve job satisfaction, such as meaningful work and recognition, can boost overall well-being.

### [Generative Organizational Culture](/capabilities/generative-organizational-culture.md) - Related

A Generative Organizational Culture is characterized by high cooperation, shared risks, and a focus on performance. Such a culture supports well-being by fostering an environment where individuals feel safe to take risks and collaborate openly. Improving organizational culture directly enhances well-being by reducing stressors associated with blame and fear.

### [Transformational Leadership](/capabilities/transformational-leadership.md) - Upstream

Transformational Leadership involves inspiring and motivating team members to exceed expectations while providing support and encouragement. Such leadership can address many organizational risk factors for burnout, such as lack of control and insufficient rewards. By promoting a positive work environment, transformational leaders enhance well-being within their teams.
