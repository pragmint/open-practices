# [Loosely Coupled Teams](https://dora.dev/capabilities/loosely-coupled-teams/)

Teams that can implement large-scale changes independently, without the need to coordinate with other teams, are often referred to as loosely coupled. These teams tend to be particularly effective. Loose coupling is enabled by team structure, charter, and architecture. When teams fully own their subsystems and have reliable integration points within the larger system, they can make changes quickly and reduce the wait times typically associated with cross-team coordination.

## Nuances

This section outlines common pitfalls, challenges, or limitations teams commonly encounter when applying this capability. The goal here is not to discourage you. Rather, the goal is to arm you with the appropriate context so that you can make an informed decision about when and how to implement the capability with your teams.

### Team Boundaries Can Evolve

Forming loosely coupled teams can sometimes be a moving target, as changes to an organization's structure and/or goals can be sudden and drastic. When this occurs, keeping the legacy team structures, charters, and architectures intact may actually add friction to the software development process. To maintain organizational agility, embrace the notion that team boundaries can and will evolve. There will be some tension as teams shift their focus and pivot their operations -- monitor this tension while staying mindful of the benefits of forming loosely coupled teams.

### Importance of Well-Defined Interfaces

For teams to work independently, they must establish clear and well-defined interfaces. This clarity ensures that teams can develop and deploy their components without tightly coupling their work with that of others. However, defining and maintaining these interfaces requires discipline and ongoing communication about changes that could affect other teams.

### Monoliths Can Work

A common misconception is that loosely coupled teams and architectures require the use of microservices. That's not true. While small, self-contained microservices can facilitate loose coupling, they are not a system requirement. A well-structured monolith with clearly delineated modules and strict internal contracts can simplify deployment and reduce overhead while still allowing teams to work independently on their respective components.

### Balancing Autonomy and Coordination

For many reasons, striking the right balance between team autonomy and cross-team coordination is critical. While autonomy accelerates change by minimizing dependencies, some level of coordination is necessary to ensure alignment with broader organizational objectives. Leaders must create structured communication channels and establish governance practices that allow teams to operate independently without drifting from shared goals.

## Supporting Practices

The following is a curated list of supporting practices to consider when looking to improve your team's Loosely Coupled Teams capability. While not every practice will be beneficial in every situation, this list is meant to provide teams with fresh, pragmatic, and actionable ideas to support this capability.

### Write Contract Tests

Develop and maintain contract tests that verify the interactions between services. Contract tests ensure that services in a system adhere to agreed-upon interfaces, which allows teams to work independently and avoid breaking integrations. By writing contract tests, teams can deploy changes with the confidence that they will not negatively impact other services, thus supporting loose coupling.

### [Decouple from Third Parties](/practices/decouple-from-third-parties.md)

Minimize direct dependencies on third-party services by using patterns such as abstraction layers or service virtualization. By decoupling from external services, teams can test and deploy their components without relying on the availability or behavior of third-party systems. This practice enhances team autonomy and reduces external bottlenecks, contributing to the capability of being loosely coupled.

### [Reduce Coupling Between Abstractions](/practices/reduce-coupling-between-abstractions.md)

Reducing coupling between abstractions creates a modular and flexible codebase. Independent, well-defined components minimize unintended side effects, making the code easier to understand, modify, and test. This modularity ensures that changes in one part of the system do not disrupt others, preserving stability and reducing cognitive load on developers. Clear abstractions and minimal dependencies also strengthen documentation and collaboration, facilitating efficient onboarding and continuous improvement.

### Document Your Team's Governance

Document clear guidelines that define roles, responsibilities, decision-making processes, and escalation paths. By writing out your team's governance, you ensure that everyone understands how decisions are made, how responsibilities are allocated, and how potential conflicts are resolved. This clarity helps teams operate autonomously while ensuring alignment, even when teams are loosely coupled.

## Adjacent Capabilities

The following capabilities will be valuable for you and your team to explore, as they are either:

- Related (they cover similar territory to Loosely Coupled Teams)
- Upstream (they are a pre-requisite for Loosely Coupled Teams)
- Downstream (Loosely Coupled Teams is a pre-requisite for them)

### [Streamline Change Approval](/capabilities/streamline-change-approval.md) - Downstream

Loosely coupled teams create the agility needed to simplify change-approval processes. With fewer cross-team dependencies, organizations can implement automated and rapid approvals, ensuring that changes move forward without unnecessary bureaucratic delays.

### [Code Maintainability](/capabilities/code-maintainability.md) - Downstream

When teams operate independently, they can focus on maintaining and improving their own codebases. This autonomy fosters higher code quality and easier updates, as the impact of changes is localized and less likely to introduce systemic issues.

### [Empowering Teams To Choose Tools](/capabilities/empowering-teams-to-choose-tools.md) - Downstream

Loosely coupled teams often enjoy the independence of selecting tools that best meet their specific needs. This tailored approach can lead to increased productivity and innovation, as teams are not forced to conform to a one-size-fits-all solution.

### [Customer Feedback](/capabilities/customer-feedback.md) - Related

Rapid, independent deployments allow teams to incorporate customer feedback more effectively. While not a direct prerequisite, a culture of loosely coupled teams aligns well with regular feedback loops that drive continuous improvement and product-market fit.

### [Visibility of Work in the Value Stream](/capabilities/visibility-of-work-in-the-value-stream.md) - Upstream

Clear visibility of work in the value stream is an essential precursor to establishing loosely coupled teams. By understanding how work flows through the organization, leaders can identify bottlenecks and design team structures that enhance autonomy and minimize dependencies.

### [Generative Organizational Culture](/capabilities/generative-organizational-culture.md) - Upstream

A generative organizational culture fosters an environment where experimentation, innovation, and continuous learning are the norms. When teams are encouraged to question assumptions and generate new ideas, theyâ€™re more prone to adopt loosely coupled practices and evolve independently.

### [Transformational Leadership](/capabilities/transformational-leadership.md) - Upstream

Transformational leadership is critical for nurturing a culture that values both team autonomy and organizational alignment. Leaders who ensure that independent team actions are aligned with strategic business objectives create the conditions necessary for maintaining loose coupling and driving continuous improvement.
