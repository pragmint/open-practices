# [Learning Culture](https://dora.dev/capabilities/learning-culture/)

_Culture_ is defined by the behaviors a group of people regularly exhibit.
It's not simply an aspirational statement that someone in marketing or HR came up with.
Building a culture that prioritizes learning, or a _learning culture_, is core to a team's desire to improve.
As such, this capability is a good place to start if you're looking to improve your team's ability to deliver impactful results.

## Nuances

This section outlines common pitfalls, challenges, or limitations teams commonly encounter when applying this capability. The goal here is not to discourage you. Rather, the goal is to arm you with the appropriate context so that you can make an informed decision about when and how to implement the capability with your teams.

### Support From Leadership is Essential

A learning culture can only be fostered if there is support from leadership.
If leaders aren't creating the space for learning, and advocating its importance, the team's focus will shift to pure execution.
If a team is only ever focused on execution, then their performance isn't likely to improve over time.

### Problem and Skill Matching

Effective problem and skill matching can be tricky and situational. Assigning tasks to individuals who aren't specialists in that line of work can create learning opportunities but, if the skill gap is too large, it may create inefficiencies that aren't worth the benefit.

### Changing Culture Takes Time

Building a learning culture is not an overnight process; it requires sustained effort and commitment from all levels of the organization. Cultural change involves altering ingrained behaviors and mindsets, which can be challenging and may face resistance. Recognizing that this transformation is a long-term investment is crucial for success.

## Assessment

To assess how mature your team or organization is in this capability, complete this short exercise.

Consider the descriptions below and score your team on the Learning Culture capability. Generally, score a 1 if learning is limited to static knowledge, a 2 if your team demonstrates ad hoc learning but you feel there is a LOT of room for improvement, a 3 if learning is encouraged and you feel there is some room for improvement, and a 4 if learning is actively prioritized and you feel your team is exemplary in the area of Learning Culture.

Don't worry if the description doesn't exactly match your situation. These descriptions are meant to be examples of situations that would qualify for the associated score.

1. **Static Knowledge:** Learning is limited to onboarding and initial training, with little emphasis on ongoing development or skill-building.
2. **Ad Hoc Learning:** Teams occasionally attend conferences or workshops, but learning is not a prioritized or structured part of the organization's culture.
3. **Encouraged Learning:** Learning is valued and encouraged, with some resources and opportunities provided for professional development, but it's not a core part of the organization's identity.
4. **Learning as a Competitive Advantage:** Learning is deeply ingrained in the organization's culture, viewed as a key driver of improvement and innovation. It is actively prioritized and invested in, helping the team to stay ahead of the curve.

The number you selected represents your overall score for this capability. If you feel like your team or organization fits somewhere in between two scores, it's okay to use a decimal. For example, if you think your team's learning represents something between static knowledge and ad hoc learning, then you would score a 2.5.

Generally, an overall score equal to or less than 3 means you'll likely gain a lot of value from experimenting with some of the supporting practices listed below. An overall score higher than 3 generally means you and your team are largely proficient, or well on your way to becoming proficient, in the area of Learning Culture; you would likely benefit from evaluating your scores in other capabilities.

## Supporting Practices

The following is a curated list of supporting practices to consider when looking to improve your team's Learning Culture capability. While not every practice will be beneficial in every situation, this list is meant to provide teams with fresh, pragmatic, and actionable ideas to support this capability.

### [Run Pair Programming Sessions](/practices/run-pair-programming-sessions.md)

Pair programming sessions facilitate collaboration, real-time code review, and knowledge sharing among developers. By working in pairs, developers can catch issues early, ensure code is comprehensible, and spread knowledge across the team. This collaborative practice also accelerates the onboarding process for new team members while helping experienced developers refine their skills. Additionally, pair programming promotes adherence to coding standards, enhancing code consistency and readability.

### [Do a Spike, or Timeboxed Experiment](/practices/do-a-spike.md)

Also referred to as building a proof-of-concept (POC), this practice involves setting aside a short period of time for your team to get hands-on experience building a solution as a way to reduce uncertainty. Spikes tend to last a couple of hours or days (at the most). They're a great way to try out a new practice, process, or tool. Given a spike's short duration, it's helpful to have an experienced member of the team lead these efforts to avoid teams from getting stuck for prolonged periods of time.

### [Talk Directly With Users](/practices/talk-directly-with-users.md)

Talking directly with users is an invaluable practice for gaining insights and understanding their needs and challenges. Field customer support calls. Host developer office hours. Run focus groups. Whatever method you use, engaging with users helps to gather real-world feedback, identify pain points, and uncover opportunities for improvement. By maintaining direct communication with users, you can ensure that your product or service aligns closely with expectations and foster a stronger connection between your team and your user base.

### [Dogfood Your Systems](/practices/dogfood-your-systems.md)

Dogfooding your systems involves having your teams use the same products or systems that your users do, allowing them to experience the same pain points firsthand. This practice helps build empathy with users, identify issues early, and drive improvements based on direct "user" experience. By regularly using your own systems as customers would, your team can gain valuable insights and ensure that the product meets the highest standards of usability and performance.

### [Use SPIN To Unearth Problems and Solutions](/practices/use-spin-to-unearth-problems-and-solutions.md)

SPIN is a question-asking framework that was originally developed for sales professionals. It focuses on understanding a person's needs through four types of questions: Situation, Problem, Implication, and Need-Payoff. Software professionals can use SPIN to uncover problems, clarify needs, and arrive at creative solutions, thus bolstering a learning culture.

## Adjacent Capabilities

The following capabilities will be valuable for you and your team to explore, as they are either:

- Related (they cover similar territory to Learning Culture)
- Upstream (they are a pre-requisite for Learning Culture)
- Downstream (Learning Culture is a pre-requisite for them)

### [Generative Organizational Culture](/capabilities/generative-organizational-culture.md) - Related

When you create a Generative Organizational Culture, you're creating an environment in which it is safe to fail. To know what works best for you and your team, you have to find out what doesn't work and reflect on why. Learning cultures support this approach.

### [Transformational Leadership](/capabilities/transformational-leadership.md) - Upstream

Without support from leadership, learning cultures can only exist in small pockets of an organization. Having transformational leadership in place supports a strong learning culture. Under such leadership, teams are regularly challenged to question their assumptions, creating intellectual stimulation.

### [Team Experimentation](/capabilities/team-experimentation.md) - Related

Both Learning Culture and Team Experimentation capabilities encourage teams to take risks, experiment, and learn from failures. By experimenting a lot, you're reinforcing your team's learning culture.
