# [Learning Culture](https://dora.dev/devops-capabilities/cultural/learning-culture/)

_Culture_ is defined by the behaviors a group of people regularly exhibit.
It's not simply an aspirational statement that someone in marketing or HR came up with.
Building a culture that prioritizes learning, or a _learning culture_, is core to a team's desire to improve.
As such, this capability is a good place to start if you're looking to improve your team's ability to deliver impactful results.

## Nuances
This section outlines common pitfalls, challenges, or limitations teams commonly encounter when applying this capability. The goal here is not to discourage you. Rather, the goal is to arm you with the appropriate context so that you can make an informed decision about when and how to implement the capability with your teams.

### Support From Leadership is Essential

A learning culture can only be fostered if there is support from leadership.
If leaders aren't creating the space for learning, and advocating its importance, the team's focus will shift to pure execution.
If a team is only ever focused on execution, then their performance isn't likely to improve over time.

### Problem and Skill Matching

Effective problem and skill matching can be tricky and situational. Assigning tasks to individuals who aren't specialists in that line of work can create learning opportunities but, if the skill gap is too large, it may create inefficiencies that aren't worth the benefit.

### Changing Culture Takes Time

Building a learning culture is not an overnight process; it requires sustained effort and commitment from all levels of the organization. Cultural change involves altering ingrained behaviors and mindsets, which can be challenging and may face resistance. Recognizing that this transformation is a long-term investment is crucial for success.

## Assessment

To assess how mature your team or organization is in this capability, complete this short exercise.

Consider the descriptions below and score your team on the Learning Culture capability. Generally, score a 1 if learning is limited to static knowledge, a 2 if your team demonstrates ad hoc learning but you feel there is a LOT of room for improvement, a 3 if learning is encouraged and you feel there is some room for improvement, and a 4 if learning is actively prioritized and you feel your team is exemplary in the area of Learning Culture.

Don't worry if the description doesn't exactly match your situation. These descriptions are meant to be examples of situations that would qualify for the associated score.

1. **Static Knowledge:** Learning is limited to onboarding and initial training, with little emphasis on ongoing development or skill-building.
2. **Ad Hoc Learning:** Teams occasionally attend conferences or workshops, but learning is not a prioritized or structured part of the organization's culture.
3. **Encouraged Learning:** Learning is valued and encouraged, with some resources and opportunities provided for professional development, but it's not a core part of the organization's identity.
4. **Learning as a Competitive Advantage:** Learning is deeply ingrained in the organization's culture, viewed as a key driver of improvement and innovation. It is actively prioritized and invested in, helping the team to stay ahead of the curve.

The number you selected represents your overall score for this capability. If you feel like your team or organization fits somewhere in between two scores, it's okay to use a decimal. For example, if you think your team's learning represents something between static knowledge and ad hoc learning, then you would score a 2.5.

Generally, an overall score equal to or less than 3 means you'll likely gain a lot of value from experimenting with some of the supporting practices listed below. An overall score higher than 3 generally means you and your team are largely proficient, or well on your way to becoming proficient, in the area of Learning Culture; you would likely benefit from evaluating your scores in other capabilities.

## Supporting Practices

The following is a curated list of supporting practices to consider when looking to improve your team's Learning Culture capability. While not every practice will be beneficial in every situation, this list is meant to provide teams with fresh, pragmatic, and actionable ideas to support this capability.

### [Host a Viewing Party](/practices/host-a-viewing-party.md)

Hosting a viewing party of conference talks, podcasts, or short videos is a great way to engage your team. As you view (or listen) to the content together, you can pause at key points or when questions arise to facilitate group discussion. This approach is particularly effective for encouraging experienced practitioners to consider _new_ ideas and perspectives, as it combines knowledge sharing with collaborative group discussion. By allowing time for conversation and reflection, viewing parties can enhance understanding and inspire innovative thinking.

### [Start a Book Club](/practices/start-a-book-club.md)

A book club may review a variety of written material, including books, whitepapers, blogs, articles, and podcast transcripts. This is another excellent practice for encouraging experienced practitioners to consider _new_ ideas and perspectives. By engaging with diverse content and participating in thoughtful discussions, team members can expand their knowledge and challenge their existing viewpoints. Book clubs provide a structured, yet flexible, environment for continuous learning and professional growth. However, if there is a lot of content to review, this burden can create drop-off for less invested parties. Be sure to manage expectations carefully.

### [Facilitate a Roundtable Discussion](/practices/host-a-roundtable-discussion.md)

Roundtable discussions are excellent tools for spurring meaningful conversations and uncovering new angles on familiar topics. Facilitating a roundtable discussion involves coming prepared with a few key talking points, then allowing the conversation to evolve organically. A good host ensures that the discussion remains productive while limiting their interventions, welcoming productive tangents that can lead to deeper insights. This format is particularly effective when the topic is already somewhat understood by the participants, as it encourages a deeper understanding through collaborative dialogue and diverse perspectives.

### [Lead a Demonstration](/practices/lead-a-demonstration.md)

Leading a demonstration is an excellent way to engage an audience by live coding, showcasing customer feedback, or presenting on a specific topic. Demonstrations can vary in length, from brief lightning talks to more extended sessions, and can be conducted as one-off events or as part of a regular series. This format is particularly effective for introducing new topics or ideas, as it allows the presenter to provide a clear and focused explanation. Including a Q&A session at the end of the demonstration can enhance understanding and provide quick clarification. Be mindful, though, that this practice is less effective for spurring in-depth discussions, as the primary focus is on _delivering content_ rather than fostering _interactive dialogue_.

### [Run Pair Programming Sessions](/practices/run-pair-programming-sessions.md)

Running pair programming sessions can help foster a learning culture within an organization because they promote continuous knowledge sharing and collaboration. In these sessions, two developers usually work together at a single workstation, enabling the real-time exchange of skills, techniques, and best practices. This type of collaborative environment accelerates the onboarding process for new team members and also helps experienced developers refine their skills through peer review and feedback.

### [Lead Workshops](/practices/lead-workshops.md)

Leading workshops is an excellent way to provide your team with hands-on experience, allowing them to actively engage with the material. Workshops are particularly effective in breaking down preconceived notions, as they offer a practical approach to learning and problem-solving. However, workshops are not ideal for introducing new topics or ideas (that is better done by leading a demonstration). Participants may struggle in a workshop if they lack foundational knowledge, which can hinder their ability to fully benefit from the hands-on experience. To ensure success, it's important to establish a solid foundation before diving into complex workshop activities.

### [Do a Spike, or Timeboxed Experiment](/practices/do-a-spike.md)

Also referred to as building a proof-of-concept (POC), this practice involves setting aside a short period of time for your team to get hands-on experience building a solution as a way to reduce uncertainty. Spikes tend to last a couple of hours or days (at the most). They're a great way to try out a new practice, process, or tool. Given a spike's short duration, it's helpful to have an experienced member of the team lead these efforts to avoid teams from getting stuck for prolonged periods of time.

### [Host a Retrospective](/practices/host-a-retrospective.md)

Hosting a retrospective is a vital practice for continuous improvement within a team or organization. These sessions can be routine or focused on a specific event, such as a postmortem. The key to a successful retrospective is to walk away with clear action items while maintaining a blameless environment. It's important to vary the format to keep it fresh and prevent it from becoming an unhelpful and repetitive ceremony. Recognize that constraints and pain points are unavoidable; the goal is not to eliminate them entirely but to reduce their frequency or impact. Be mindful of the trade-offs when introducing new controls, ensuring they donâ€™t become excessive. Retrospectives are excellent for fine-tuning processes and addressing immediate issues, though they are less effective for sparking visionary changes.

### [Talk Directly With Users](/practices/talk-directly-with-users.md)

Talking directly with users is an invaluable practice for gaining insights and understanding their needs and challenges. Field customer support calls. Host developer office hours. Run focus groups. Whatever method you use, engaging with users helps to gather real-world feedback, identify pain points, and uncover opportunities for improvement. By maintaining direct communication with users, you can ensure that your product or service aligns closely with expectations and foster a stronger connection between your team and your user base.

### [Dogfood Your Systems](/practices/dogfood-your-systems.md)

Dogfooding your systems involves having your teams use the same products or systems that your users do, allowing them to experience the same pain points firsthand. This practice helps build empathy with users, identify issues early, and drive improvements based on direct "user" experience. By regularly using your own systems as customers would, your team can gain valuable insights and ensure that the product meets the highest standards of usability and performance.

### [Start a Community Of Practice](/practices/start-a-community-of-practice.md)

Starting a community of practice means providing a dedicated space where a variety of practices (like demonstrations, workshops, book clubs, etc.) can be performed. This collaborative environment fosters continuous learning, sharing of best practices, and collective problem-solving. By bringing together practitioners with shared interests, a community of practice can drive innovation, enhance skills, and promote a learning culture.

### [Use SPIN To Unearth Problems and Solutions](/practices/use-spin-to-unearth-problems-and-solutions.md)

SPIN is a question-asking framework that was originally developed for sales professionals. It focuses on understanding a person's needs through four types of questions: Situation, Problem, Implication, and Need-Payoff. Software professionals can use SPIN to uncover problems, clarify needs, and arrive at creative solutions, thus bolstering a learning culture.
