# [Documentation Quality](https://dora.dev/devops-capabilities/process/documentation-quality/)

Documentation quality refers to the accuracy, completeness, and accessibility of internal documentation, enabling teams to effectively collaborate, make informed decisions, and deliver high-quality software quickly and reliably. By investing in documentation quality, developers can reduce errors, improve productivity, and enhance overall performance.

## Nuance

This section outlines common pitfalls, challenges, or limitations teams commonly encounter when applying this capability. The goal here is not to discourage you. Rather, the goal is to arm you with the appropriate context so that you can make an informed decision about when and how to implement the capability with your teams.

### Importance of Clear and Findable Documentation

Clear and findable documentation is essential for effective knowledge sharing and collaboration within teams. Without it, teams may struggle to understand existing systems, leading to a decrease in development speed and reliability.

### Reliability and Maintenance of Documentation

Documentation must be actively maintained and updated to ensure it remains relevant and accurate. This requires a deliberate effort to review and refine documentation regularly. Sometimes misleading documentation can be worse than missing documentation.

## Assessment

To assess how mature your team or organization is in this capability, complete this short, two-part exercise.

First, score yourself on the Documentation Quality capability. Generally, score yourself a 1 if Documentation Quality is completely lacking from your team or organization, a 2 if there is a LOT of room for improvement, a 3 if there is some room for improvement, and a 4 if your team or organization is exemplary in the area of Documentation Quality.

Next, consider the descriptions below. Don't worry if the description doesn't exactly match your situation. These descriptions are meant to be examples of situations that would qualify for the associated score.

1. **Minimal:** The technical documentation is often outdated, incomplete, or inaccurate, making it difficult to rely on when working with the services or applications. It's hard to find what is needed, and others are often asked for help.
2. **Basic:** The technical documentation is somewhat reliable, but it's not always easy to find what is needed. Updates are sporadic, and multiple sources must be dug through to get the required information. In times of crisis, the documentation might be glanced at, but it's not always trusted.
3. **Good:** The technical documentation is generally reliable, and what is needed can usually be found with some effort. Updates are made regularly, but not always immediately. The documentation is used to help troubleshoot issues, but clarification from others might still be needed.
4. **Excellent:** The technical documentation is comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date. What is needed can easily be found, and the documentation is relied on heavily when working with the services or applications. When issues arise, the documentation is confidently reached for to help troubleshoot and resolve problems.

The number you selected represents your overall score for this capability. If you feel like your team or organization fits somewhere in-between two scores, it's okay to use a decimal. For example, if you think your team or organization has somewhere between basic and good Documentation Quality, you would score a 2.5.

An overall score of 2.5 or below means you'll probably gain a lot of value from experimenting with some of the supporting practices listed below. An overall score of 3 or higher means you and your team are largely proficient, or well on your way to becoming proficient, in the area of Documentation Quality; you would likely benefit from evaluating your scores in other capabilities.

## Supporting Practices

The following is a curated list of supporting practices to consider when looking to improve your team's Documentation Quality capability. While not every practice will be beneficial in every situation, they are meant to provide teams with fresh, pragmatic, and actionable ideas to support this capability.

### [Use Documentation Auto-Generation Tooling](/practices/use-documentation-auto-generation-tooling.md)

Automate the creation of documentation using tools that generate comprehensive and up-to-date documentation directly from the source code or configuration files. This practice ensures that documentation stays in sync with the codebase, reducing the manual effort required to maintain it, and minimizes the risk of outdated or incomplete information. Tools like [Swagger](https://github.com/swagger-api) create executable documentation, while tools like [RepoAgent](https://github.com/OpenBMB/RepoAgent) use LLMs to keep the documentation in sync as the codebase changes.

### [Implement A Documentation Search Engine](/practices/implement-a-documentation-search-engine.md)

Implementing a documentation search engine enables team members to quickly find relevant documentation, reducing the time spent searching for information and increasing productivity.

### [Schedule Regular Documentation Audits](/practices/schedule-regular-documentation-audits.md)

Scheduling regular documentation audits ensures that documentation remains up-to-date, comprehensive, and accurate. As systems and processes evolve, it's important to spend some time auditing our existing documentation to ensure they're accurate.

## Adjacent Capabilities

The following capabilities will be valuable for you and your team to explore, as they are either:

- Related (they cover similar territory to Documentation Quality)
- Upstream (they are a pre-requisite for Documentation Quality)
- Downstream (Documentation Quality is a pre-requisite for them)

### [Continuous Integration](/capabilities/continuous-integration.md) - Downstream

High-quality documentation is essential for effective continuous integration, as it enables teams to understand the existing systems and make informed decisions about changes.

### [Learning Culture](/capabilities/learning-culture.md) - Upstream

Without a culture of learning and knowledge sharing, high-quality documentation doesn't get actively contributed to. This can lead to large gaps of documentation or worse, out of date or incorrect information.

### [Code Maintainability](/capabilities/code-maintainability.md) - Related

Good documentation is critical for maintaining code quality, as it helps developers understand the codebase and make informed decisions about changes.
