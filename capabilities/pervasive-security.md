# [Pervasive Security](https://dora.dev/capabilities/pervasive-security/)

Pervasive Security emphasizes integrating security practices into the daily workflow across all phases of software development. The goal is to shift security considerations to the *early stages* of the development lifecycle. This is also known as "shifting left," which helps prevent costly security defects and enhances software delivery performance. Implementing the Pervasive Security capability leads to more secure systems and reduces the time spent remediating issues, benefiting both development speed and system stability.

## Nuances

This section outlines common pitfalls, challenges, or limitations teams commonly encounter when applying this capability. The goal here is not to discourage you. Rather, the goal is to arm you with the appropriate context so that you can make an informed decision about when and how to implement the capability with your teams.

### Pressure to Deliver Features  

Developers are often measured and rewarded for feature delivery speed, with incentives to deliver often conflicting with security considerations. When security reviews or additional testing slow down delivery, developers face pressure to meet deadlines and avoid looking like they're underperforming. This can lead to resistance against security processes, rushed implementations that bypass security checks, or treating security requirements as optional overhead rather than essential quality gates. The tension between quick delivery and thorough security can create a culture where security becomes a burden rather than a shared responsibility.

### Adversarial Security Reviews

Security integration works best when development and InfoSec teams have mutual trust and understanding. Without this foundation, security reviews become adversarial checkpoints rather than collaborative partnerships. Simple steps like regular check-ins, sharing context about upcoming features, and treating security feedback as guidance rather than criticism can transform the relationship. When teams view each other as partners rather than gatekeepers, security insights flow more naturally and vulnerabilities are caught earlier.

### Tool Fragmentation

Disconnected security tools create friction and inconsistent coverage across development workflows. Teams often struggle with multiple point solutions that don't integrate well - static analysis tools, dependency scanners, container security tools, and runtime monitoring systems that operate in isolation. This fragmentation means security checks happen at different stages with different standards, creating gaps in coverage and requiring developers to context-switch between multiple tools. When security tooling becomes a burden rather than an enabler, teams may bypass or disable tools to maintain velocity, undermining the goal of Pervasive Security.

## Assessment

To assess how mature your team or organization is in this capability, complete this short exercise.

Consider the descriptions below and score yourself on the Pervasive Security capability. Generally, score a 1 if security is lacking from your team or organization, a 2 if you feel there is a lot of room for improvement, a 3 if you feel there is some room for improvement, and a 4 if your team or organization is exemplary in the area of security.

Don't worry if the description doesn't exactly match your situation. These descriptions are meant to be examples of situations that would qualify for the associated score.

1. **Reactive:** Security is addressed only after issues arise, and there is little consideration of security concerns during development.
2. **Basic:** Some security best practices are followed, but security is not a primary consideration during development and security reviews are infrequent.
3. **Integrated:** Security is a key consideration during development, with internal security training and some use of automated security tooling.
4. **Pervasive:** Security is deeply ingrained in the development culture. Continuous security testing, automated security tooling, and routine security reviews are integrated throughout the software development lifecycle.

The number you selected represents your overall score for this capability. If you feel like your team or organization fits somewhere in between two scores, it's okay to use a decimal. For example, if you think your team or organization has somewhere between basic and integrated security, you would score a 2.5.

Generally, an overall score equal to or less than 3 means you'll likely gain a lot of value from experimenting with some of the supporting practices listed here. An overall score higher than 3 generally means you and your team are largely proficient, or well on your way to becoming proficient, in the area of Pervasive Security; you would likely benefit from evaluating your scores in other capabilities.

## Supporting Practices

The following is a curated list of supporting practices to consider when looking to improve your team's Pervasive Security capability. While not every practice will be beneficial in every situation, this list is meant to provide teams with fresh, pragmatic, and actionable ideas to support this capability.

### Automate Security Testing in CI/CD Pipelines

Add automated security checks to the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. This ensures that security is continuously assessed alongside functional and performance tests, catching issues early and at scale. Automated security testing reduces manual effort, helps detect vulnerabilities quickly, and keeps the codebase safer.

### Conduct Security Awareness Training for Developers

Regularly conduct security training that covers common vulnerabilities, secure coding practices, and awareness of new security threats. This equips developers with the knowledge to write secure code, recognize risks early, and reduce the likelihood of security incidents. Continuous education leads to a security-conscious culture and more resilient software.

### Implement Threat Modeling

Practice systematic threat modeling during design phases to identify and mitigate security risks early. Use structured approaches like STRIDE or PASTA methodologies to analyze potential threats, vulnerabilities, and attack vectors. This proactive approach helps teams understand security implications before implementation begins, enabling better architectural decisions and reducing the likelihood of security flaws being introduced into the codebase.

### Establish Security Metrics

Define and track security metrics, including vulnerability density, time to remediation, and security test coverage. Use data to establish baselines, set targets, and monitor trends over time. These metrics provide visibility into the effectiveness of your security practices, help prioritize security investments, and enable teams to demonstrate security progress to stakeholders while identifying areas that need attention. 

## Adjacent Capabilities

The following capabilities will be valuable for you and your team to explore, as they are either:

- Related (they cover similar territory to Pervasive Security)
- Upstream (they are a pre-requisite for Pervasive Security)
- Downstream (Pervasive Security is a pre-requisite for them)

### [Test Automation](/capabilities/test-automation.md) - Related

Test Automation establishes the practice of automatically validating software quality through various testing approaches, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Automated security testing is a fundamental component of Test Automation, covering vulnerability scanning, dependency analysis, and security regression testing.

By sharing the same automation principles and infrastructure, Test Automation and Pervasive Security work together to ensure security validation happens consistently and efficiently. This means that security testing leverages the same automation frameworks, CI/CD pipelines, and testing practices that teams already use for functional testing. Security becomes a natural extension of the overall quality assurance process, rather than a separate concern.

### [Monitoring and Observability](/capabilities/monitoring-and-observability.md) - Related

Monitoring and Observability provide real-time insights into system behavior, performance, and security events through comprehensive logging, metrics, and alerting systems. This capability enables teams to detect and respond to security incidents as they occur in production environments.

By implementing Pervasive Security practices during development, teams create systems that are more observable and secure by design. This means that security controls, logging, and monitoring points are built into applications from the start, making it easier to detect breaches, verify security controls, and facilitate rapid incident response.

### [Continuous Integration](/capabilities/continuous-integration.md) - Upstream

Continuous Integration (CI) ensures that frequent changes are automatically tested and integrated into the codebase, providing rapid feedback on code quality and functionality. By providing automated build and test pipelines, CI creates the necessary infrastructure for embedding security checks into the development workflow. This upstream relationship enables Pervasive Security to leverage existing automation patterns, ensuring security testing becomes a natural part of the development process, rather than an additional burden.
