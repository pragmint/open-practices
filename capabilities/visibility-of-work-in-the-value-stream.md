# [Visibility of Work in the Value Stream](https://dora.dev/devops-capabilities/process/work-visibility-in-value-stream/)

## Key Points

### Summary

Visibility of work represents the extent to which teams have a good understanding of the flow of work from the business all the way through to customers, and whether they have visibility into this flow, including the status of products and features.

### Capabilities of Lean Product Management

* Visibility of work in the value stream
* Working in Small Batches
* Team Experimentation
* Visibility into customer feedback

### Measurements

* Profitability
* Market share
* Productivity

### How to Implement

* Teams understand how work moves through the business from idea to customer, including products or features. (Could be added to how to improve)
* Team has visibility into the flow of this work.
* Flow of working is shown on visual displays or dashboards.

### [Value Stream Mapping](https://books.google.com.do/books/about/Value_Stream_Mapping_How_to_Visualize_Wo.html?id=ll7imAEACAAJ&redir_esc=y) (Maybe a practice)

Metrics:

* Lead time: the time from the point a process accepts a piece of work to the point it hands that work off to the next downstream process.
* Process time: the time it would take to complete a single item of work if the person performing it had all the necessary information and resources to complete it and could work uninterrupted.
* Percent complete and accurate (%C/A): the proportion of times that a process receives something from an upstream process that it can use without requiring rework.

### Visualize the current status of work

* Card wall
* Story Board
* Kaban Board

### Common pitfalls (Maybe good for nuance section)

* Overestimating knowledge: Teams often lack full visibility into the value stream, requiring cross-team collaboration to uncover gaps.
* Incomplete mapping: Omitting parts of the value stream leads to missed improvement opportunities.
* Wrong focus: Prioritizing non-bottlenecks wastes effort without improving lead times.
* Lack of authority: Teams need decision-making power to implement changes effectively.

* Work in Process Limits
* Visual management

### How to improve visibility of the work stream

* Use visual tools: Provide displays to track work, flow, lead times, and rework to identify improvement opportunities.
* Create value stream maps: Map workflows from idea to outcome, measure key metrics, and plan future improvements.
* Share and update artifacts: Ensure visibility of mapping results across the organization and update them at least annually.

### How to measure

* Is there a value stream map?
* Does everybody in the organization have access to a visual display that shows what they're working on and the status of their work?
* Are statistics on metrics such as lead times and %C/A available to the team?
