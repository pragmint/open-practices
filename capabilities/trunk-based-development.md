# [Trunk-Based Development](https://dora.dev/devops-capabilities/technical/trunk-based-development/)

## Key Points

* Developer push code directly into trunk
* Release branches are usually merged back to trunk as soon as possible.

* Is a requiresd practice for continuous integration
* Fast test suite.

* Break work in smaller batches

* DORA shows that teams achieve higher levels of software delivery and operational performance if they follow:
  * < 3 active branches in repo
  * Merge branches to trunk at least once a day
  * Don't have code freezes and don't have integration phases

* Common Pitfalls
  * An overly heavy code-review process
  * Performing code reviews asynchronously
  * Not running automated tests before committing code

* Ways to IMprove
  * Develop in small batches
  * Perform synchronous code review
  * Implement comprehensive automated testing
  * Have a fast build
  * Create a core group of advocates and mentors

* Ways to measure trunk-based development
  * Active branches on the application's code repository
  * Code freeze periods
  * Frequency of merging branches and forks to trunk
  * Check time taken to approve code changes

* More research
  * Short-lived Branches or Direct Commits
  * Feature Flags
  * Automated Testing & CI/CD
  * Code Review & Pair Programming
  * Fast & Reliable Releases
