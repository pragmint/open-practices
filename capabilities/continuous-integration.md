# [Continuous Integration](https://dora.dev/capabilities/continuous-integration/)

Continuous Integration (CI), as a capability, means that developers are integrating code changes into the main branch regularly, ideally several times a day. Each integration triggers an automated build and series of tests to detect errors quickly, ensuring the software remains in a deployable state. The primary benefit of CI is fast feedback on stability and integration concerns.

## Nuances

This section outlines common pitfalls, challenges, or limitations teams commonly encounter when applying this capability. The goal here is not to discourage you. Rather, the goal is to arm you with the appropriate context so that you can make an informed decision about when and how to implement the capability with your teams.

### Large Changes

It can be tempting to delay integrating changes. Developers might want to wait for QA or bundle related work together, or they may be unsure how to split things up. The trouble is that long-lived branches get harder to merge and slow down feedback, which works against Continuous Integration. For CI to be effective, it's important to keep changes small and merge them often. That way, integration stays smooth and feedback comes quickly.

### Slow or Unreliable Checks

If automated tests and other checks take too long to run, developers may skip running them or fail to integrate changes frequently, which increases the risk of issues going undetected. Ideally, all CI checks should run in under 90 seconds to ensure quick feedback and maintain developer engagement with the CI process. See the supporting practice below "Parallelize Long-Running Tests" for more on this.

### Infrastructure and Environment Issues

The problem isn’t always in the code. Resource limits, network hiccups, race conditions, or differences between local machines and CI systems can all cause builds to fail. When that happens, developers often lose trust and simply restart the build instead of investigating the root of the issue. The goal is to make CI reliable enough that failures always matter. Track recurring environment problems and fix them at the source, so trust in the system grows instead of erodes.

### Integration Blockers and Bottlenecks

Integration blockers and bottlenecks, such as mandatory code reviews or approval processes, can prevent developers from integrating frequently. When code sits in review queues for extended periods, merge conflicts become more likely. Additionally, if the review process is too rigid or slow, developers may batch larger changes to minimize the overhead, which contradicts the core principle of this capability: frequent, small integrations.

## Assessment

To assess how mature your team or organization is in this capability, complete this short exercise.

Consider the descriptions below and score your team on this capability. Generally, score a 1 if integration is infrequent and painful, a 2 if it is routine and coordinated but you feel there is a LOT of room for improvement, a 3 if it is regular and smooth and you feel there is some room for improvement, and a 4 if it is continuous and seamless.

Don't worry if the description doesn't exactly match your situation. These descriptions are meant to be examples of situations that would qualify for the associated score.

1. **Infrequent & Painful:** Integration is done rarely, with large batches of changes, requiring multiple levels of approval. Merge conflicts occur often and feedback is uncertain.
2. **Routine & Coordinated:** Integration happens routinely (e.g., weekly), with moderate-sized changes, requiring some approval and coordination. There are occasional merge conflicts but there is a good understanding of the feedback.
3. **Frequent & Smooth:** Integration happens frequently (e.g., daily), with small, incremental changes, requiring minimal approval. Painful merge conflicts are rare and there is a high degree of confidence in the feedback.
4. **Continuous & Seamless:** Integration happens continuously, with tiny, incremental changes, rarely requiring approval. There are virtually no painful merge conflicts and there is complete confidence in the feedback, which is immediate.

The number you selected represents your overall score for this capability. If you feel like your team or organization fits somewhere in between two scores, it's okay to use a decimal. For example, if you think integration is somewhere between routine/coordinated and frequent/smooth, then you would score a 2.5.

Generally, an overall score equal to or less than 3 means you'll likely gain a lot of value from experimenting with some of the supporting practices listed below. An overall score higher than 3 generally means you and your team are largely proficient, or well on your way to becoming proficient, in the area of integration; you would likely benefit from evaluating your scores in other capabilities.

## Supporting Practices

The following is a curated list of supporting practices to consider when looking to improve your team's Continuous Integration capability. While not every practice will be beneficial in every situation, this list is meant to provide teams with fresh, pragmatic, and actionable ideas to support this capability.

### Run Automated Tests During Build Process

Automatically execute unit tests, integration tests, and other automated tests as part of the CI build process. This ensures that every code change is validated against the existing test suite, catching regressions early and maintaining code quality. The tests should run quickly and provide clear feedback on what failed and why.

### Run Linter in Pre-Commit Hook

Configure linting tools to run automatically before code is committed to version control. This catches code style violations, potential bugs, and basic security issues early in the development process. Preventing these issues from reaching the main branch reduces the burden on the CI pipeline.

### Run CVE and CWE Checks During the Build Process

Integrate Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) scanning into the CI build process. This helps identify known security vulnerabilities in dependencies and common coding weaknesses that could lead to security issues, ensuring security is built into the development process from the start.

### Parallelize Long-Running Tests

If the test suite takes too long to run, divide it into smaller, parallelized tests that can be executed simultaneously. This reduces the time required for CI builds, improving feedback speed and encouraging frequent integrations.

### Treat Broken Builds Like Outages

Establish a rule that when the CI build breaks, fixing the build takes precedence over other work. This practice ensures a consistently stable main branch, builds trust in the CI process, and prevents technical debt from accumulating.

### Perform Non-Integration-Blocking Code Review

Implement code review processes that provide feedback and learning opportunities *without* blocking the integration of changes into the main branch. This allows teams to maintain the benefits of peer review while preserving the rapid feedback cycles that make CI effective. Practices like pair programming, mob programming, or daily group code review sessions can provide continuous feedback and knowledge sharing without creating integration blocks or bottlenecks.

### [Create and Manage Ephemeral Environments](/practices/create-and-manage-ephemeral-environments.md)

Ephemeral environments are isolated, production-like spaces that can be spun up on demand. Each environment starts with a clean state. Developers can generate, load, and reset data without affecting other developers. This reduces test flakiness, ensures consistent results, and supports more accurate debugging. When integrated into CI/CD pipelines, ephemeral environments give teams fast, reliable feedback across app, data, and infrastructure changes.

## Adjacent Capabilities

The following capabilities will be valuable for you and your team to explore, as they are either:

- Related (they cover similar territory to Continuous Integration)
- Upstream (they are a pre-requisite for Continuous Integration)
- Downstream (Continuous Integration is a pre-requisite for them)
