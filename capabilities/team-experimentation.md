# [Team Experimentation](https://dora.dev/capabilities/team-experimentation/)

Team Experimentation is about giving software teams problems to solve instead of pre-groomed requirements to execute. It encourages teams to take small, measurable steps to try different approaches and see what works best. By focusing on the desired outcome or problem to solve, teams can design experiments—like testing a new process, tool, or feature—and measure whether their actions lead to success.

This approach helps teams learn quickly, adapt, and avoid wasting time on heavy upfront planning. It’s all about creating a cycle of trying, learning, and improving, aligned with clear business goals or challenges.

## Nuance

### Foster a Safe-to-Fail Environment

When teams feel safe to experiment—knowing failures won’t derail progress—they’re more likely to find faster, better ways to work. Much of the usual waste comes from people following orders instead of trusting their expertise, but they won’t take risks unless they see peers fail safely or even be praised for it. Clear boundaries, like a "failure budget," are also key to maintaining trust; without them, unchecked decisions can lead to misalignment and friction when leadership intervenes. By balancing safety with clear expectations, you create an environment where experimentation and trust can thrive together.

### Teams Need The Right Context To Make Good Decisions

Every experiment needs to be evaluated through the lens of the cost/benefit to the organization. To understand those factors, teams need to understand details of the organization that might not traditionally be available to developers. Things like: profit margin, customer NPS, strategic initiatives, etc. For example, teams might need access to data on customer acquisition costs to determine whether an experiment aimed at improving user retention is likely to yield a sufficient return on investment. This context empowers teams to prioritize experiments effectively.

### More Difficult To Know When Something Will Be Done

Creative endeavors are more difficult to estimate than administrative ones. Whenever teams are coming up with new ideas, the risk of scope creep increases. As such, the scoping of experiments should be a routine part of timeline discussions. A pragmatic balance between experimentation and execution needs to be struck for an organization to operate smoothly.

### Measure Experimentation Outcomes

Experiments should have clear hypotheses and measurable outcomes. Without proper metrics and analysis, it's difficult to learn from experiments or make informed decisions. Establishing robust measurement practices ensures that experimentation leads to actionable insights.

### Ensure Cross-Team Collaboration

Experimentation within one team can impact other teams or parts of the system. Open communication about ongoing experiments helps prevent conflicts and duplicated efforts. Collaborating on experiments can amplify its benefits and fosters a culture of collective learning.

## Supporting Practices

### [Measure Impact With Double Loop Learning](/practices/measure-impact-with-double-loop-learning.md)

Double Loop Learning helps teams reflect on their experiments and question their assumptions. By doing so, they refine their understanding of the problem and adjust their approach to better align with organizational goals. This process enables teams to learn, adapt, and improve more effectively.

### [Do a Spike, or Timeboxed Experiment](/practices/do-a-spike.md)

Also referred to as building a proof-of-concept (POC), this practice involves setting aside a short period of time for your team to get hands-on experience building a solution as a way to reduce uncertainty. Spikes tend to last a couple of hours or days (at the most). They're a great way to try out a new practice, process, or tool. Given a spike's short duration, it's helpful to have an experienced member of the team lead these efforts to avoid teams from getting stuck for prolonged periods of time.

### [Host a Retrospective](/practices/host-a-retrospective.md)

Hosting a retrospective is a vital practice for continuous improvement within a team or organization. These sessions can be routine or focused on a specific event, such as a postmortem. The key to a successful retrospective is to walk away with clear action items while maintaining a blameless environment. It's important to vary the format to keep it fresh and prevent it from becoming an unhelpful and repetitive ceremony. Recognize that constraints and pain points are unavoidable; the goal is not to eliminate them entirely but to reduce their frequency or impact. Be mindful of the trade-offs when introducing new controls, ensuring they don’t become excessive. Retrospectives are excellent for fine-tuning processes and addressing immediate issues, though they are less effective for sparking visionary changes.

### [Talk Directly With Users](/practices/talk-directly-with-users.md)

Talking directly with users is an invaluable practice for gaining insights and understanding their needs and challenges. Field customer support calls. Host developer office hours. Run focus groups. Whatever method you use, engaging with users helps to gather real-world feedback, identify pain points, and uncover opportunities for improvement. By maintaining direct communication with users, you can ensure that your product or service aligns closely with expectations and foster a stronger connection between your team and your user base.

### [Dogfood Your Systems](/practices/dogfood-your-systems.md)

Dogfooding your systems involves having your teams use the same products or systems that your users do, allowing them to experience the same pain points firsthand. This practice helps build empathy with users, identify issues early, and drive improvements based on direct "user" experience. By regularly using your own systems as customers would, your team can gain valuable insights and ensure that the product meets the highest standards of usability and performance.

## Adjacent Capabilities

The following capabilities will be valuable for you and your team to explore, as they are either:

- Related (they cover similar territory to Code Maintainability)
- Upstream (they are a pre-requisite for Code Maintainability)
- Downstream (Code Maintainability is a pre-requisite for them)

### [Learning Culture](/capabilities/learning-culture.md) - Related

A Learning Culture complements Team Experimentation by promoting continuous learning and knowledge sharing. When teams are encouraged to learn from both successes and failures, they are more likely to engage in experimentation. Together, these capabilities foster an environment where innovation thrives and improvements are rapidly adopted.

### [Generative Organizational Culture](/capabilities/generative-organizational-culture.md) - Upstream

A Generative Organizational Culture is characterized by high cooperation, shared risks, and a focus on performance over rules. Such a culture supports Team Experimentation by valuing open communication and trust. This environment empowers teams to experiment without fear, enhancing the effectiveness of their innovations.

### [Transformational Leadership](/capabilities/transformational-leadership.md) - Upstream

Transformational Leadership involves leaders inspiring and motivating teams to exceed expectations and embrace change. Leaders who exhibit this style can encourage Team Experimentation by providing vision and support. This leadership fosters an atmosphere where teams feel confident to explore new ideas.

### [Empowering Teams To Choose Tools](/capabilities/empowering-teams-to-choose-tools.md) - Related

Sometimes the tools that are selected influence the effort required to implement a set of requirements. As such, empowering teams to choose tools is intertwined with that team's ability to experiment.
