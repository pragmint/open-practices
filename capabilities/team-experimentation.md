# [Team Experimentation](https://dora.dev/capabilities/team-experimentation/)

The Team Experimentation capability is about giving software teams problems to solve, instead of pre-determined requirements to execute, and encouraging small, measurable experiments to see what works best. By focusing on the desired outcome or problem to solve, teams can design a variety of experiments — like testing a new process, tool, or feature — and measure whether their actions lead to success.

This approach helps teams learn quickly, adapt, and avoid wasting time on heavy upfront planning. It’s all about creating a cycle of trying, learning, and improving that is aligned with clear business goals or challenges.

## Nuances

This section outlines common pitfalls, challenges, or limitations teams commonly encounter when applying this capability. The goal here is not to discourage you. Rather, the goal is to arm you with the appropriate context so that you can make an informed decision about when and how to implement the capability with your teams.

### Balance Trust With Experimentation

When teams feel safe to experiment — knowing failures won’t derail progress — they’re more likely to find faster, better ways to work. Employees typically won’t take risks and experiment with new approaches unless they see peers fail safely, or even be praised for it. Drawing safe-to-fail boundaries, like having a "failure budget," is key to encouraging experimentation while maintaining trust; without these boundaries, team members may hesitate to take risks or make decisions for fear of ruffling feathers. Teams need the assurance that the status quo can be disrupted with new ideas. By balancing safety with clear expectations, you can create an environment where experimentation and trust can thrive together.

### Teams Need the Right Context to Evaluate Experiments

Every experiment should be evaluated by looking at its cost-benefit ratio to the organization. To do this, teams need to understand details of the organization like profit margin, customer NPS, strategic initiatives, and so on. These details aren't typically in the domain of software developers. For example, teams might need access to data on customer acquisition costs to determine whether an experiment aimed at improving user retention is likely to yield a sufficient return on investment. While some digging may be necessary, this context empowers teams to effectively evaluate experiments.

### Keep Scope Creep in Check

Creative endeavors are more difficult to estimate than administrative ones. Whenever teams are coming up with new ideas, the risk of scope creep increases. As such, the scoping of experiments should be a routine part of timeline discussions. A pragmatic balance between experimentation and execution needs to be struck for an organization to operate smoothly.

### Measure Outcomes of Experiments

Experiments should have clear hypotheses and measurable outcomes. Without proper metrics and analysis, it's difficult to learn from experiments or make informed decisions. Establishing robust measurement practices ensures that experimentation leads to actionable insights.

### Ensure Cross-Team Collaboration

Experimentation within one team is typical, but this can impact other teams or parts of the organization. Open communication about ongoing experiments helps prevent conflicts and duplicated efforts. Collaborating on experiments can amplify its benefits and foster a culture of collective learning.

## Assessment

To assess how mature your team or organization is in this capability, complete this short exercise.

Consider the descriptions below and score yourself on the Team Experimentation capability. Generally, score a 1 if experimentation is minimal or completely lacking from your team, a 2 if it is highly controlled and you feel there is a lot of room for improvement, a 3 if it is emerging and you feel there is some room for improvement, and a 4 if your team or organization is exemplary in the area of Team Experimentation.

Don't worry if the description doesn't exactly match your situation. These descriptions are meant to be examples of situations that would qualify for the associated score.

1. **Minimal or No Experimentation:** Teams follow a strict, rigid plan with little room for deviation or experimentation and must seek approval for even minor changes. They have limited visibility into the organization's overall goals and context, and they must pull information from leadership on an ad-hoc basis.
2. **Highly Controlled Experimentation:** Teams are allowed to explore new ideas but within tightly defined parameters and with close oversight from leadership. Deadline pressure regularly takes priority over idea exploration. Teams must request access to relevant context and information, which is provided on an ad-hoc basis.
3. **Emerging but Limited Experimentation:** Teams have some flexibility to try new approaches but must seek permission from leadership or follow established protocols for most changes. They have access to some organizational context, including goals and objectives, but may not have direct access to customer feedback or the financial performance of the company.
4. **Self-Directed Innovation:** Teams have autonomy to pursue new ideas and make decisions. Their experiments are informed by direct access to customer feedback and relevant context that is proactively shared by leadership, including the organization's vision, goals, strategic priorities, and financial state.

The number you selected represents your overall score for this capability. If you feel like your team or organization fits somewhere in between two scores, it's okay to use a decimal. For example, if you think team experimentation is somewhere between highly controlled and emerging, you would score a 2.5.

Generally, an overall score equal to or less than 3 means you'll likely gain a lot of value from experimenting with some of the supporting practices listed here. An overall score higher than 3 generally means you and your team are largely proficient, or well on your way to becoming proficient, in the area of Team Experimentation; you would likely benefit from evaluating your scores in other capabilities.

## Supporting Practices

The following is a curated list of supporting practices to consider when looking to improve your Team Experimentation capability. While not every practice will be beneficial in every situation, this list is meant to provide teams with fresh, pragmatic, and actionable ideas to support this capability.

### Measure Impact With Double Loop Learning

[Double Loop Learning](https://hbr.org/1977/09/double-loop-learning-in-organizations) — stepping back to re-examine underlying objectives, early assumptions, and established mental models — helps teams reflect on their experiments and question previous thinking at a deeper level. By doing this, teams can refine their understanding of a problem and adjust their approach to better align with organizational goals. The process of double loop learning enables teams to learn, adapt, and improve more effectively.

### Do a Spike, or Timeboxed Experiment

Also referred to as building a proof-of-concept (POC), this practice involves setting aside a short period of time for your team to get hands-on experience building a solution as a way to reduce uncertainty. Spikes tend to last a couple of hours or days (at the most). They're a great way to try out a new practice, process, or tool. Given a spike's short duration, it's helpful to have an experienced member of the team lead these efforts to avoid teams from getting stuck for prolonged periods of time.

### Talk Directly With Users

Talking directly with users is an invaluable practice for gaining insights and understanding their needs and challenges. Field customer support calls. Host developer office hours. Run focus groups. Whatever method you use, engaging with users helps to gather real-world feedback, identify pain points, and uncover opportunities for improvement. By maintaining direct communication with users, you can ensure that your product or service aligns closely with expectations and foster a stronger connection between your team and your user base.

### Dogfood Your Systems

Dogfooding your systems involves having your teams use the same products or systems that your users do, allowing them to experience the same pain points firsthand. This practice helps build empathy with users, identify issues early, and drive improvements based on direct "user" experience. By regularly using your own systems as customers would, your team can gain valuable insights and ensure that the product meets the highest standards of usability and performance.
