# [Customer Feedback](https://dora.dev/capabilities/customer-feedback/)

Customer Feedback means listening to what users say about your software and using that information to make it better. It helps you know if you're building the right features, if people are actually using them, and if they're getting value from your product. When teams pay attention to customer feedback, they build better software and achieve better business results.

Customer feedback comes in many forms. You might get direct feedback through surveys, interviews, or support tickets. You might see usage data showing how people actually use your features. You might hear anecdotes from sales teams or customer success managers. Not all feedback is equally valuable, however data coming directly from end users tends to be more reliable than second-hand information from internal teams or stakeholders.

The key is making customer feedback a regular part of how teams work. This means incorporating user insights into planning meetings, using customer stories to prioritize features, and measuring whether recent changes actually solve the problems users face. When feedback becomes part of a team's normal development process, they stop building features that nobody wants and start delivering real value.

## Nuance

### Delayed Feedback Gathering

When feedback is collected too late in the development lifecycle, it limits the team's ability to make timely adjustments. Late feedback often results in wasted resources and missed opportunities to address user needs effectively. It’s crucial to integrate feedback mechanisms early and continuously throughout the development cycle.

### Misinterpreting Customer Needs

Teams may misinterpret feedback or fail to identify the core problems users face. This can happen due to confirmation bias, lack of domain expertise, or inadequate research methods. Misunderstanding customer needs often leads to developing features that do not fully solve user problems, undermining the product's effectiveness.

### Lack of Empowerment to Act on Feedback

Even when feedback is accurately gathered, teams must be empowered to make changes based on it. A rigid development process or excessive management control can hinder responsiveness, limiting the product's ability to evolve based on user insights. This lack of flexibility can reduce both user satisfaction and team morale.

## Supporting Practices

The following is a curated list of supporting practices to consider when looking to improve your team's Customer Feedback capability. While not every practice will be beneficial in every situation, this list is meant to provide teams with fresh, pragmatic, and actionable ideas to support this capability.

### Conduct User Interviews

Regularly schedule interviews with users to gather qualitative insights on their experiences, challenges, and needs. These interviews can reveal deeper user motivations and issues that are not apparent from metrics alone. By directly engaging with users, teams can prioritize features that address real problems, leading to increased adoption and satisfaction.

### Perform A/B Testing

Introduce A/B testing to evaluate different versions of a feature or product change with users. By measuring user reactions and behavior, teams can identify the most effective solutions before full implementation. This approach reduces the risk of deploying features that do not meet user expectations and maximizes the impact of each release.

### Shift Teams To Track Outcomes Instead of Outputs

It’s easy to default to tracking what’s easy to count: tickets closed, lines of code, story points. But these are outputs, not outcomes. To drive meaningful improvement, displays should connect work to its impact: customer behavior, system reliability, revenue generated, or time to resolve issues. When teams see the impact of their work, they can make smarter trade-offs and course-correct faster.

## Adjacent Capabilities

The following capabilities will be valuable for you and your team to explore, as they are either:

- Related (they cover similar territory to Customer Feedback)
- Upstream (they are a pre-requisite for Customer Feedback)
- Downstream (Customer Feedback is a pre-requisite for them)

### [Team Experimentation](/capabilities/team-experimentation.md) - Related

Team Experimentation encourages teams to test new ideas and solutions based on user insights. By fostering a culture of experimentation, teams can quickly validate ideas and refine their approach, leading to more user-centric products.

By combining Customer Feedback with Team Experimentation, teams can systematically test hypotheses derived from user insights. This relationship enables teams to move beyond simply collecting feedback to actively experimenting with solutions, creating a more dynamic and responsive development process.

### [Visibility of Work in the Value Stream](/capabilities/visibility-of-work-in-the-value-stream.md) - Upstream

Making work visible helps teams understand how their efforts align with user feedback and value delivery. It ensures that customer feedback is integrated into the work pipeline, allowing for more transparent and effective prioritization of tasks.

Visibility of Work in the Value Stream provides the foundational transparency needed to effectively incorporate Customer Feedback into decision-making processes. Without clear visibility into how work flows through the system, teams struggle to connect user insights to actionable improvements in their development practices.

### [Working in Small Batches](/capabilities/working-in-small-batches.md) - Downstream

Working in small batches enables faster iteration and better responsiveness to customer feedback. By deploying changes incrementally, teams can quickly validate features and adjust based on user reactions, improving both user satisfaction and development efficiency.

Customer Feedback becomes most valuable when teams can act on it quickly through small batch delivery. This capability depends on having established feedback mechanisms in place, as the rapid iteration cycle requires continuous input from users to guide the direction of incremental improvements.

### [Monitoring Systems to Inform Business Decisions](/capabilities/monitoring-systems-to-inform-business-decisions.md) - Related

Effective monitoring systems capture user behavior and feedback, providing data-driven insights that inform product decisions. These systems ensure that customer feedback is not just collected but also analyzed and used to guide product development, improving software delivery outcomes.

By integrating Customer Feedback with Monitoring Systems to Inform Business Decisions, teams can create a comprehensive feedback loop that combines qualitative user insights with quantitative behavioral data. This relationship enables teams to make more informed decisions by triangulating different types of user feedback and system performance metrics.
