# [Customer Feedback](https://dora.dev/capabilities/customer-feedback/)

The Customer Feedback capability entails listening to what users say about your software and using that information to make it better. It helps you know if you're building the right features, if people are actually using them, and if they're getting value from your product. When teams pay attention to customer feedback, they build better software and achieve better business results.

Customer feedback comes in many forms. You might get direct feedback through surveys, interviews, or support tickets. You might see usage data showing how people actually use your features. You might hear anecdotes from sales teams or customer success managers. Not all feedback is equally valuable. However, data coming directly from end users tends to be more reliable than second-hand information from internal teams or stakeholders.

The key to implementing this capability is *making customer feedback a regular part of how your team works*. This means incorporating user insights into planning meetings, using customer stories to prioritize features, and measuring whether recent changes actually solve the problems users face. When feedback is woven into the development process, the team will build features that users want and that deliver real value.

## Nuances

This section outlines common pitfalls, challenges, or limitations teams commonly encounter when applying this capability. The goal here is not to discourage you. Rather, the goal is to arm you with the appropriate context so that you can make an informed decision about when and how to implement the capability with your teams.

### Gathering Feedback Too Late

When feedback is collected too late in the development lifecycle, it limits the team's ability to make timely adjustments. Late feedback often results in wasted resources and missed opportunities to address user needs effectively. It’s crucial to integrate feedback mechanisms *early and continuously*, throughout the development cycle.

### Misinterpreting Customer Needs

Teams may misinterpret feedback or fail to identify the core problems users face. This can happen due to confirmation bias, lack of domain expertise, or inadequate research methods. Misunderstanding customer needs often leads to developing features that do not fully solve user problems, undermining the product's effectiveness.

### Lack of Empowerment to Act on Feedback

Even when feedback is accurately gathered, teams must be empowered to make changes based on it. A rigid development process or excessive management control can hinder responsiveness, limiting the product's ability to evolve based on user insights. This lack of flexibility can reduce both user satisfaction and team morale.

## Assessment

To assess how mature your team or organization is in this capability, complete this short exercise.

Consider the descriptions below and score yourself on the Customer Feedback capability. Generally, score a 1 if user feedback is completely lacking from your team or organization, a 2 if you feel there is a lot of room for improvement, a 3 if you feel there is some room for improvement, and a 4 if your team or organization is exemplary in the area of Customer Feedback.

Don't worry if the description doesn't exactly match your situation. These descriptions are meant to be examples of situations that would qualify for the associated score.

1. **Absent:** User feedback from releases aren’t collected.
2. **Reactive:** User feedback is gathered but usually only after significant issues arise, and it’s acted upon sporadically.
3. **Informative:** User feedback is regularly gathered and may influence feature prioritization, but meaningful shifts in priority don’t happen often.
4. **Impactful:** User feedback is regularly gathered, based on recent changes, and acted upon in a timely manner to enhance the product and influence decisions.

The number you selected represents your overall score for this capability. If you feel like your team or organization fits somewhere in between two scores, it's okay to use a decimal. For example, if you think user feedback is both reactive and informative, you would score a 2.5.

Generally, an overall score equal to or less than 3 means you'll likely gain a lot of value from experimenting with some of the supporting practices listed here. An overall score higher than 3 generally means you and your team are largely proficient, or well on your way to becoming proficient, in the area of Customer Feedback; you would likely benefit from evaluating your scores in other capabilities.

## Supporting Practices

The following is a curated list of supporting practices to consider when looking to improve your team's Customer Feedback capability. While not every practice will be beneficial in every situation, this list is meant to provide teams with fresh, pragmatic, and actionable ideas to support this capability.

### Conduct User Interviews

Regularly schedule interviews with users to gather qualitative insights on their experiences, challenges, and needs. These interviews can reveal deeper user motivations and issues that are not apparent from metrics alone. By directly engaging with users, teams can prioritize features that address real problems, leading to increased adoption and satisfaction.

### Perform A/B Testing

Introduce A/B testing to evaluate different versions of a feature or product change with users. By measuring user reactions and behavior, teams can identify the most effective solutions before full implementation. This approach reduces the risk of deploying features that do not meet user expectations and maximizes the impact of each release.

### Shift Teams to Track Outcomes Instead of Outputs

It’s easy to default to tracking what’s easy to count: tickets closed, lines of code, story points. But these are *outputs*, not *outcomes*. To drive meaningful improvement, displays should connect work to desired outcomes around customer behavior, system reliability, revenue generated, or time to resolve issues. When teams see the impact of their work, they can make smarter trade-offs and course-correct faster.

## Adjacent Capabilities

The following capabilities will be valuable for you and your team to explore, as they are either:

- Related (they cover similar territory to Customer Feedback)
- Upstream (they are a pre-requisite for Customer Feedback)
- Downstream (Customer Feedback is a pre-requisite for them)

### [Team Experimentation](/capabilities/team-experimentation.md) - Related

Team Experimentation encourages teams to test new ideas and solutions based on user insights. By fostering a culture of experimentation, teams can quickly validate ideas and refine their approach, leading to more user-centric products. When teams implement both Customer Feedback with Team Experimentation capabilities, they can systematically test hypotheses derived from user insights. This enables teams to move beyond simply collecting feedback to actively experimenting with solutions, creating a more dynamic and responsive development process.

### [Monitoring Systems to Inform Business Decisions](/capabilities/monitoring-systems-to-inform-business-decisions.md) - Related

Effective monitoring systems capture user behavior and feedback, providing data-driven insights that inform product decisions. These systems ensure that customer feedback is not just collected but also analyzed and used to guide product development, improving software delivery outcomes. By implementing the capabilities of Customer Feedback and Monitoring Systems to Inform Business Decisions, teams can create a comprehensive feedback loop that combines qualitative user insights with quantitative behavioral data. This enables teams to make more informed decisions by triangulating different types of user feedback and system performance metrics.

### [Visibility of Work in the Value Stream](/capabilities/visibility-of-work-in-the-value-stream.md) - Upstream

Visibility of Work in the Value Stream provides the foundational transparency needed to effectively incorporate customer feedback into decision-making processes. Without clear visibility into how work flows through the system, teams struggle to connect user insights to actionable improvements in their development practices.

### [Working in Small Batches](/capabilities/working-in-small-batches.md) - Downstream

Working in Small Batches depends on having established feedback mechanisms in place -- the rapid iteration cycle requires continuous input from users to guide the direction of incremental improvements. Customer feedback becomes most valuable when teams can quickly act on it through small-batch delivery. By deploying changes incrementally, teams can quickly validate features and adjust based on user reactions, improving both user satisfaction and development efficiency.
