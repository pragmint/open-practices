## What it’s about

Jennifer Moore shares her experiences building developer buy-in for OTel. The Q&A covers alert fatigue, on-call culture, and how to position telemetry as a tool that empowers developers rather than burdens them.

## Why it’s worth watching/reading

It highlights the *human side* of observability. Jennifer explains how OTel can win over skeptics by reducing 2am false alarms and giving developers context they actually care about.

## Pause and Ponder

- How much noisy or low-value telemetry do we currently have, and how does it affect on-call rotations?  
- What would it look like for devs in our org to self-serve dashboards instead of waiting on ops?  
- How fast is our deploy-to-insight cycle today, and what would “minutes, not days” unlock?  
- How do we make telemetry feel like relief, not surveillance?  

## Takeaway

Developer adoption hinges on relief. When OTel reduces pointless alerts and empowers self-service, it transforms from “extra work” into a quality-of-life improvement.
