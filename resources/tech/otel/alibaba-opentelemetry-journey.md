## What it’s about

This talk from Alibaba engineers describes their journey implementing OpenTelemetry at scale. It covers the challenges of migrating from proprietary monitoring stacks, building internal champions, and standardizing telemetry across diverse services.

## Why it’s worth watching

It’s a rare enterprise case study told from the inside — with practical detail on both technical hurdles and organizational dynamics. Alibaba shows that OTel adoption requires not just instrumentation, but strong leadership and persistence to overcome skepticism.

## Pause and Ponder

- Who in our org has the authority and conviction to enforce OTel adoption?  
- Which legacy systems or processes would create the same friction Alibaba faced?  
- How can we ensure telemetry remains comparable across hundreds of services?  
- What objections might surface from entrenched teams or leaders, and how could we frame the benefits?  
- What governance model would help us scale adoption without chaos?   

## Takeaway

OTel adoption succeeds when backed by champions with enough authority to enforce change. Alibaba’s journey underscores the socio-technical nature of observability: success depends as much on politics as on code.
