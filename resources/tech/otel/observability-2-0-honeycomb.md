## What it’s about

Honeycomb lays out the core distinction between “Observability 1.0” (centered on dashboards, metrics, and alerting) and “Observability 2.0” (centered on wide, structured events that allow flexible, ad-hoc exploration). The post argues that OTel is enabling this shift across the industry.

## Why it’s worth reading

This is the canonical articulation of what “Observability 2.0” means. Many teams still think observability is just monitoring with more dashboards; this article helps reframe it as a fundamentally different practice.

## Pause and Ponder

- Are we treating observability as pre-built dashboards, or as a flexible tool for answering new questions?
- How could wide structured events help us see connections we’re missing today?
- Where in our org would shifting from “1.0” to “2.0” make the biggest cultural impact?

## Takeaway

Observability 2.0 isn’t about collecting more data; it’s about widening and unifying your view. Capture broad, richly attributed events, even when they seem redundant. If costs are a concern, sample widely instead of stripping context, or use open-source visualizers to explore freely. Bring logs, metrics, and traces together into a single feed so you can zoom in for detail, step back for the full picture, and connect signals that might otherwise stay hidden. In this model, telemetry becomes a living, navigable picture of your system rather than a static dashboard.
