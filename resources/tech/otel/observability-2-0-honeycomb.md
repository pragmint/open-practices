## What it’s about

Honeycomb lays out the core distinction between “Observability 1.0” (centered on dashboards, metrics, and alerting) and “Observability 2.0” (centered on wide, structured events that allow flexible, ad-hoc exploration). The post argues that OTel is enabling this shift across the industry.

## Why it’s worth reading

This is the canonical articulation of what “Observability 2.0” means. Many teams still think observability is just monitoring with more dashboards; this article helps reframe it as a fundamentally different practice.

## Pause and Ponder

- Are we treating observability as pre-built dashboards, or as a flexible tool for answering new questions?  
- How could wide structured events help us see connections we’re missing today?  
- Where in our org would shifting from “1.0” to “2.0” make the biggest cultural impact?  

## Takeaway

Observability 2.0 isn’t just more data — it’s a mindset shift. Wide structured events let engineers ask questions they didn’t anticipate, turning telemetry from a static dashboard into a dynamic conversation.
