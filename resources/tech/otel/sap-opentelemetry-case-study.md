# SAP Case Study: Massive-Scale Observability Modernization

Resource type: Case Study

## What it’s about

SAP overhauled observability across 11,000+ OpenSearch instances by adopting OpenTelemetry and rebuilding ingestion pipelines with Data Prepper. They unified logs, metrics, and traces into a consistent telemetry model while migrating from OpenSearch 1.x to 2.x with minimal disruption.

## Why it’s worth reading

This case study shows what OTel adoption looks like at *extreme* scale — in a heavily regulated, enterprise-grade environment. It’s proof that the unified telemetry model isn’t just theory or startup hype: it works even in massive, legacy-heavy organizations. The migration strategy also provides concrete patterns for reducing risk during major observability shifts.

## Pause and Ponder

- How did SAP manage both modernization and migration without service disruption?  
- What role did standardization (schemas, pipelines) play in making 11,000+ instances manageable?  
- Which of SAP’s approaches could scale down to smaller orgs?  

## Takeaway

OpenTelemetry provides a path for unifying observability across even the largest, most complex enterprises — not just greenfield startups. SAP’s success shows that with the right abstractions and migration planning, scale is not a blocker but an opportunity.
