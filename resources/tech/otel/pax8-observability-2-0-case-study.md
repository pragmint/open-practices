## What it’s about

Pax8 shifted from traditional observability tools with user-based pricing to Honeycomb’s Observability 2.0 platform. By adopting wide structured events and event-based pricing, they unlocked access for their entire engineering org while reducing costs by 30%.

## Why it’s worth reading

Pax8 highlights the cultural side of Observability 2.0. Their story shows how democratizing access — letting *everyone* explore telemetry data, not just senior engineers — boosts curiosity, experimentation, and shared ownership of reliability. It’s also a concrete proof point that OTel-based approaches can *lower* costs, not just add more.

## Pause and Ponder

- How does pricing and accessibility shape who actually uses observability data in your org?  
- What happens when product managers and junior developers can explore telemetry, not just ops leads?  
- What trade-offs did Pax8 make to gain both cost efficiency and coverage?  

## Takeaway

Observability 2.0 isn’t only about better data — it’s about enabling more people to use that data. Pax8 proved that when access broadens, culture shifts toward curiosity and resilience.
