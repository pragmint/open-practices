## What it’s about

This session explores how observability practices have shifted from “three pillars” thinking to the more modern OTel-inspired view of wide structured events. Panelists discuss lessons from real organizations: what worked, what failed, and how they bridged siloed tools.

## Why it’s worth watching/reading

It connects the dots between OTel’s philosophy and lived team experience. The candid discussion about “tools teams won’t give up” makes it clear that correlation, not replacement, is the pragmatic path forward.

## Pause and Ponder

- Where are we still treating metrics/logs/traces as separate in our own stack?  
- Which silos exist in our org today, and how could IDs/tags correlate them?  
- What advantages do we gain from capturing everything in a single structured format?  
- Which success patterns resonate most with our org’s culture?  

## Takeaway

Observability practices evolve slowly, and teams rarely throw tools away. Success comes from correlation across silos, not dogmatic purity.
