The body of each of these resource pages is likely to be very different. So, instead of providing you with a bunch of structure to fill in the blanks, we'll share some things you might want to consider when contributing a resource and then let you take it from there.

## What Sort of Resources Are Appropriate For This Section?

1. Code snippet(s) that showcase a technique or principle in action
2. Video / conference talk
3. Article
4. Book
5. Workshop
6. Code Kata
7. Roundtable discussion points
8. Anything else that helps people understand a concept or set of concepts

## When Should You Add a New Resource Page?

Once you have a resource in mind, ask yourself the following two questions:

1. Are there multiple existing [practices](/practices/) that would benefit from this supporting resource?
2. Is this resource especially high-quality (i.e., something you want to/regularly share with peers for support)?

If your answer to these questions is "yes," then proceed with adding it to the repository!

## What Sort of Notes Should I Include On This Page?

This is where the format will likely vary greatly from resource to resource. Generally, the following content is helpful for these example resources:

1. Video
  a. timestamps where certain concepts are covered, where there are good points to ponder, or where you can pause and ask questions of your team
  b. brief description of the resource (that can be used by someone coordinating a watch party with their team)
  c. brief description of how this resource can bring value to viewers
2. Workshop
  a. slide deck
  b. speaker notes
  c. brief description of the resource (that can be used by someone coordinating a workshop with their team)
  d. brief description of how this resource can bring value to the team
3. Book
  a. core concepts discussed in the book and select chapters
  b. estimated time range for reading the book
  c. brief description of how this resource can bring value to the reader
  d. brief description of the resource (that can be used by someone coordinating a book club with their team)


After you've thought through these questions and reviewed other [resources](/resources/), feel free to replace this section with whatever you deem appropriate.
