# <start_replace>Title of Practice (note: this should start with a verb to ensure it's actionable)<end_replace>

<start_replace>
High-level description of practice.

Start with a simple 1 sentence definition of the practice. Then briefly explain the subtleties of the practice to help the reader get a better idea of the proposed practice. End with a brief description of the potential benefits of the practice.

Try to keep the text brief, relatable, and motivational. Our audience wants a quick read. The writing style should be conversational, not academic; the details should be higher level (think overview or summary), not too technical.

## Nuance

This section outlines common pitfalls, challenges, or limitations teams commonly encounter when applying this practice. The goal here is not to discourage you. Rather, the goal is to arm you with the appropriate context so that you can make an informed decision about when and how to implement the practice with your team(s).

<start_replace>
Each nuance point should have its own section starting with `###` and the title followed by a brief description (3-5 sentences). Ensure that each section covers either a common pitfall, challenge, or limitation that teams commonly encounter when applying this practice. Aim to have somewhere between 2-5 nuance subsections.

## Gaining Traction

The following actions will help your team implement this practice.

<start_replace>
Each gaining traction action should have its own section starting with `###` and the title followed by a brief description (3-5 sentences). Each section should cover some action or set of actions a team can take to generate buy-in, get practical experience, or make the practice a common part of the normal routine. If there any generally applicable [resources](/resources/) can be leveraged to support each subsection, make sure to link to them here. If the resource you have in mind is super specific to this practice, you can include that link and breakdown here.

For these sections, you may want to take inspiration from the generic practices from [Learning Culture](/capabilities/learning-culture.md) - and how to put those general practices to use by adding specifics such as talking points, demonstration instructions, roundtable discussion prompts, and links to external resources.

For example, a general practice is to Facilitate a Roundtable Discussion. In the Run Pair Programming Sessions practice, we elaborate on how to facilitate a roundtable discussion by listing specific discussion prompts related to pair programming such as, "How frequently do we engage in pair programming sessions, and are they integrated into our regular workflow?"

Another example of a general practice is to Start a Book Club. In the Reduce Coupling Between Abstractions practice, we list specific books that can help put this practice to use such as "Refactoring" by Martin Fowler and "Clean Architecture" by Robert C. Martin.

See the Gaining Traction section in [other practice pages](/practices/) for more examples.

## Supported Capabilities

This practice supports enhanced performance in the following capabilities.

<start_replace>
The final section lists a handful of other DORA Capabilities (roughly 1-4) that are supported by this Practice. Each Capability you list here should have a title (starting with `###`) and brief description (2-4 sentences). The title should be an  existing, linked DORA [Capability](/capabilities/) from the repository. The description text should cover how this particular practice supports the Capability listed.
