## Nuances

This section outlines common pitfalls, challenges, or limitations teams commonly encounter when applying this practice. The goal here is not to discourage you. Rather, the goal is to arm you with the appropriate context so that you can make an informed decision about when and how to implement the practice with your team(s).

<start_replace>
```
Each nuance point should have its own section starting with `###` and the title followed by a brief description (3-5 sentences). Ensure that each section covers either a common pitfall, challenge, or limitation that teams commonly encounter when applying this practice. Aim to have somewhere between 2-5 nuance subsections.

## Gaining Traction

The following actions will help your team implement this practice.

<start_replace>
```
The goal of this section is to show readers what it takes to guide a team starting with zero awareness to full adoption of this practice. There will be numerous social and technical hurdles that need to be handled. Each sub-section (action) listed here should be ordered chronologically for teams looking to gain traction.

Each Gaining Traction action should have its own section starting with `###` and the title (e.g., Run a Retrospective). Then, add a brief description (3-5 sentences) of the action, including ways the team can generate buy-in, get practical experience, or make the practice a common part of the normal routine. These sections might be steps someone could take to get their team to adopt the practice. The goal is to equip someone who wants to introduce this practice to their team as turnkey as possible.

For the actions you list here, you may want to take inspiration from the general practices in [Learning Culture](/capabilities/learning-culture.md#supporting-practices). Briefly discuss how to put those general practices to use by adding specifics such as unique talking points, demonstration instructions, roundtable discussion prompts, and links to external resources.

For example, a general practice is to Facilitate a Roundtable Discussion. In the Run Pair Programming Sessions practice page, we elaborate on *how* to facilitate a roundtable discussion by listing **specific discussion prompts** related to pair programming, such as "How frequently do we engage in pair programming sessions, and are they integrated into our regular workflow?"

Another example of a general practice is to Start a Book Club. In the Reduce Coupling Between Abstractions practice, we list specific books that can help put this practice to use, such as *Refactoring* by Martin Fowler and *Clean Architecture* by Robert C. Martin.

Generally applicable [resources](/resources/), such as videos and books, may be leveraged to support an action; make sure to link to them here. If the resource you have in mind is super specific to the practice, then you can include a link and brief description here.

See the Gaining Traction section in [other practice pages](/practices/) for more examples.

## Success Criteria

<start_replace>
```
How will the reader measure the impact/success of adopting this practice? Paint some pictures of what "done" looks like (since this will vary by team)? 
```
<end_replace>

## Supported Capabilities

This practice supports enhanced performance in the following capabilities.

<start_replace>
```
The final section lists a handful of other DORA Capabilities (roughly 1-4) that are supported by this Practice. Each Capability you list here should have a title (starting with `###`) and brief description (2-4 sentences). The title should be an existing, linked DORA [Capability](/capabilities/) from the repository. The description text should cover how this particular practice supports the Capability listed.
```
